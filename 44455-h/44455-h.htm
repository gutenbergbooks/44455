<h1>NOÉMI.</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="center">THE STAIR PERILOUS.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jean del&#39; Peyra</span> was standing scraping a staff
to form a lance-shaft. The sun shone hot upon him,
and at his feet lay his shadow as a blot.</p>

<p class="indent">He was too much engrossed in his work to look
about him, till he heard a voice call from somewhere
above his head&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Out of the way, clown!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then there crashed down by him a log of wood
that rolled to his feet and was followed by another
piece.</p>

<p class="indent">Now only did Jean look up, and what he saw made
him drop his half-finished shaft and forget it. What
Jean saw was this: a girl at some distance above him
on the face of the rock, swaying a long-handled hammer,
with which she was striking at, and dislodging,
the steps by which she had ascended, and by means of
which alone could she return.</p>

<p class="indent">The cliff was of white limestone, or rather chalk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
not such as Dover headlands are composed of, and
which have given their name to Albion, but infinitely
more compact and hard, though scarcely less white.
The appearance of the stone was that of fine-grained
white limestone. A modern geologist peering among
its fossils would say it was chalk. But the period of
this tale far antedates the hatching out of the first
geologist.</p>

<p class="indent">The cliff was that of La Roque Gageac, that shoots
up from the Dordogne to the height of four hundred
and sixty feet above the river. The lower portion is,
however, not perpendicular; it consists of a series of
ledges and rapid inclines, on which stands clustered,
clinging to the rock, the town of Gageac. But two
thirds of the height is not merely a sheer precipice,
it overhangs. Half-way up this sheer precipice the
weather has gnawed into the rock, where was a bed of
softer stone, forming a horizontal cavern, open to the
wind and rain, with a roof extending some forty feet,
unsupported, above the hard bed that served as floor.</p>

<p class="indent">At some time unknown a stair had been contrived
in the face of the rock, to reach this terrace a hundred
feet above the roofs of the houses below; and
then a castle had been built in the cave, consisting of
towers and guard-rooms, halls and kitchens; a well
had been sunk in the heart of the mountain, and this
impregnable fastness had been made into a habitation
for man.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
It could be reached in but one way, by the stair
from below. It could not be reached from above, for
the rock overhung the castle walls.</p>

<p class="indent">But the stair itself was a perilous path, and its
construction a work of ingenuity. To make the position&mdash;the
eagle nest in the rock&mdash;absolutely inaccessible
to an enemy, the stair had been contrived so
that it could be wrecked by those flying up it, with
facility, and that thereby they might cut off possibility
of pursuit.</p>

<p class="indent">The method adopted was this.</p>

<p class="indent">Holes had been bored into the rock-face in gradual
ascent from the platform at the foot of the rock
to the gate-tower of the castle, nestled on the platform
in the precipice. In each such hole a balk or
billet of wood was planted, sliced away below where it
entered, and this end was then made fast by a wedge
driven in under it. From each step, when once secured,
that above it could next be made firm. To
release the steps a tap from underneath sufficed to
loosen the wedge and send it and the balk it supported
clattering down.</p>

<p class="indent">And now the girl was striking away these steps.
What was her purpose? Had she considered what
she was doing? To destroy the means of ascent was
easy enough; to replace it a labour exacting time and
patience. Was she a fool? was she mad?</p>

<p class="indent">There was some method in her madness, for she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
had not knocked away a succession of steps, but two
only, with one left in position between.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ware, fool!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And down the face of the rock and clattering to
his feet fell a third.</p>

<p class="indent">This was too much.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean ran to the foot of the stair and hastened up
it till he reached the gap. Further he could not proceed&mdash;a
step had been dislodged; the next remained
intact. Then came another break, a second step in
place, and then the third break. Above that stood
the girl, swinging the long-handled mallet with which
she had loosened the wedges and struck down the
steps they held up. She was a handsome girl with
dusky skin, but warm with blood under it, dark loose
hair, and large deep brown eyes. She stood, athletic,
graceful, poised on her stage, swaying the hammer,
looking defiantly, insolently, at the youth, with lips
half open and pouting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know what you are about, madcap?&quot;
said he.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perfectly. Making you keep your distance,
fool.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep distance!&quot; said the youth. &quot;I had no
thought of you. I was not pursuing you&mdash;I did not
know you were here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now I have woke you to see me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What of that? You had acted like a mad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
thing. I cannot help you, I cannot leap to you.
Nothing would make me do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing? Not if I said, &#39;Come, assist me
down&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could not leap the space. See you&mdash;if one step
only were thrown down I might venture, but not
when every alternate one between us is missing. To
leap up were to ensure my fall at the next gap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not need your help. I can descend. I can
spring from one step to the next over the gaps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And risk a fall and a broken neck?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then there is one madcap the less in this world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For what have you done this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A prank.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A prank! Yes; but to replace the steps takes
time and pains.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall expend neither on them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will give trouble to others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it amuses me, what care I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young man looked at the strange girl with
perplexity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If every peg of wood were away,&quot; said she, &quot;I
could yet descend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How? Are you a bird&mdash;can you fly? Not a cat,
not a squirrel could run up or down this rock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fool! I should slip down by the rope. Do you
not know that there is a windlass? Do you suppose
they take their kegs of wine, their meat, their bread,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
their fuel up this spider stair? I tell you that there
is a rope, and at the end of it a bar of wood. They
let this down and bring up what they want affixed to
the bar. At pleasure, any man may go up or down
that way. Do you not see? It must be so. If they
were fast and all the ladders were gone, how should
they ever descend? Why, they could not mend the
stairs from aloft. It must be done step by step from
below. Do you see that, fool?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see that perfectly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well; I have but to run up, make love to
the custodian, and he would swing me down. There;
it is easy done!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had best cast down the hammer and let me
replace the steps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll come down without them and without a rope.
I can leap. If I cannot creep up as a cat, I can
spring down like one&mdash;aye! and like a squirrel, too,
from one lodging place to another. Stand back and
see me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stay!&quot; said Jean. &quot;Why run the risk when not
needed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I like the risk&mdash;it is pepper and mustard
to my meat of life. Stand back, clown, or I will
spring and strike you over&mdash;and down you go and
crack your foolish pate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I go&mdash;you go also&mdash;do you not see that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look aloft!&quot; said the girl. &quot;Up in that nest&mdash;whenever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
the English are about, up goes into it the
Bishop of Sarlat, and he takes with him all his treasure,
his gold cups and patens, his shrines for holy
bones all set with gems, and his bags of coin. There
he sits like an old grey owl, Towhit! towhoo&mdash;towhit!
towhoo! and he looks out this way, that&mdash;to see where
houses are burning and smoke rises, and when at
night the whole world is besprent with red fires&mdash;as
the sky is with stars, where farms and homesteads are
burning. And he says &#39;Towhit! towhoo! I have my
cups and my patens and my coin-bags, and my dear
little holy bones, all safe here. Towhit! towhoo!
And best of all&mdash;I am safe&mdash;my unholy old bones
also, whoo! whoo! whoo! Nobody can touch me&mdash;whoo!
whoo! whoo!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he there now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he is not. There is no immediate danger.
Only a few as guard, that is all. If I were a man, I&#39;d
take the place and smoke the old owl out, and rob
him of his plunder. I&#39;d keep the shrines, and throw
the holy rubbish away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How would you do that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been considering. I&#39;d be let down over
the edge of the cliff and throw in fireballs, till I had
set the castle blazing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I&#39;d have grappling-irons and crook them
to the walls, and swing in under the ledge, and leap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
on the top of the battlements, and the place would
fall. I&#39;d cast the old bishop out if he would not go,
and carry off all his cups and shrines and coin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be sacrilege!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah! What care I?&quot; Then, after enjoying the
astonishment of the lad, she said: &quot;With two or
three bold spirits it might be done. Will you join
me? Be my mate, and we will divide the plunder.&quot;
She burst into a merry laugh. &quot;It would be sport to
smoke out the old owl and send him flying down
through the air, blinking and towhooing, to break his
wings, or his neck, or his crown there&mdash;on those stones
below.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not English&mdash;I&#39;m no brigand!&quot; answered
the young man vehemently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m English!&quot; said the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What? An English woman or devil?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m English&mdash;I&#39;m Gascon. I&#39;m anything where
there is diversion to be got and plunder to be obtained.
Oh, but we live in good times! Deliver me
from others where there is nothing doing, no sport,
no <i>chevauchée</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> no spoil, no fighting.&quot;</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_1_1">
<span class="label">[1]</span></a>
A <i>chevauchée</i> was an expedition to ravage a tract of country.
Originally it signified a feudal service due from a vassal
to his seigneur in private wars.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Then suddenly she threw away the hammer and
spread her arms as might a bird preparing to fly, bent
her lithe form as might a cricket to leap.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
&quot;Stand aside! Go back! &#39;Ware, I am coming!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The lad hastily beat a retreat down the steps. He
could do no other. Each step was but two feet in
length from the rock. There was no handrail; no
two persons could pass on it. Moreover, the impetus
of the girl, if she leaped from one foothold to the
next, and the next, and then again to the stair where
undamaged, would be prodigious; she would require
the way clear that she might descend bounding, swinging
down the steep flight, two stages at a leap, till she
reached the bottom. An obstruction would be fatal
to her, and fatal to him who stood in her way.</p>

<p class="indent">No word of caution, no dissuasion was of avail.
In her attitude, in the flash of her eyes, in the tone
of her voice, in the thrill that went through her agile
frame, Jean saw that the leap was inevitable. He
therefore hastened to descend, and when he reached
the bottom, turned to see her bound.</p>

<p class="indent">He held his breath. The blood in his arteries
stood still. He set his teeth, and all the muscles of
his body contracted as with the cramp.</p>

<p class="indent">He saw her leap.</p>

<p class="indent">Once started, nothing could arrest her.</p>

<p class="indent">On her left hand was the smooth face of the rock,
without even a blade of grass, a harebell, a tuft of
juniper growing out of it. On her right was void.
If she tripped, if she missed her perch, if she miscalculated
her weight, if she lost confidence for one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
instant, if her nerve gave way in the slightest, if she
was not true of eye, nimble of foot, certain in
judging distance, then she would shoot down just as
had the logs she had cast below.</p>

<p class="indent">As certainly as he saw her fall would Jean spring
forward in the vain hope of breaking her fall, as
certainly to be struck down and perish with her.</p>

<p class="indent">One&mdash;a whirl before his eyes. As well calculate
her leaps as count the spokes in a wheel as it revolves
on the road.</p>

<p class="indent">One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;thirty&mdash;a thousand&mdash;nothing!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, clown!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was at the bottom, her hands extended, her
face flushed with excitement and pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see&mdash;what I can dare and do.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="center">WHO IS THE FOOL NOW?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">There</span> boiled up in the youth&#39;s heart a feeling
of wrath and indignation against the girl who in
sheer wantonness had imperiled her life and had
given to him a moment of spasm of apprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">Looking full into her glittering brown eyes, he
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have cast at me ill names. I have been to
you but clown and fool; I have done nothing to merit
such titles; I should never have thrown a thought
away on you, but have gone on scraping my shaft,
had not you done a silly thing&mdash;a silly thing. Acted
like a fool, and a fool only!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You dare not do what I have done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If there be a need I will do it. If I do it for a
purpose there is no folly in it. That is folly where
there is recklessness for no purpose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had a purpose!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A purpose?&mdash;what? To call my attention to
you, to make me admire your daring, all to no end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
Or was it in mere inconsiderate prank? A man is not
brave merely because he is so stupid that he does not
see the consequences before him. A blind man may
walk where I should shrink from treading. And
stupidity blinds some eyes that they run into danger
and neither see nor care for the danger or for the consequences
that will ensue on their rashness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl flushed with anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not accustomed to be spoken to thus,&quot; she
said, and stamped her foot on the pavement of the
platform.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All the better for you that it is spoken at last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And who are you that dare say it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I am Jean del&#39; Peyra.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl laughed contemptuously. &quot;I never heard
the name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have told you my name, what is yours?&quot; asked
the boy, and he picked up his staff and began once
more to point it.</p>

<p class="indent">There was indifference in his tone, indifference in
the act, that exasperated the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do not care&mdash;I will not say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; he answered, scraping leisurely at the wood.
&quot;I do not greatly care. Why should I? You have
shown me to-day that you do not value yourself, and
you do not suppose, then, that I can esteem one who
does not esteem herself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You dare say that!&quot; The girl flared into fury.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
She stooped to pick up the hammer. Jean put his
foot on it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said he. &quot;You would use that, I suppose,
to knock out my brains, because I show you no homage,
because I say that you have acted as a fool, that
your bravery is that of a fool, that your thoughts&mdash;aye,
your thoughts of plunder and murder against the
Bishop of Sarlat, your old owl&mdash;towhit, towhoo! are
the thoughts of a fool. No&mdash;I do not care for the
name of a fool.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you run up the steps? Why did you
cry to me to desist from knocking out the posts?
Why concern yourself a mite about me, if you so
despise me?&quot; gasped the girl, and it seemed as
though the words shot like flames from her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because we are of like blood&mdash;that is all!&quot;
answered Jean, coolly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Like blood! Hear him&mdash;hear him! He and I&mdash;<i>he</i>&mdash;he
and I of like blood, and he a del&#39; Peyra!
And I&mdash;I am a Noémi!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So&mdash;Noémi! That is your name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I,&quot; continued the girl in her raging wrath,
&quot;I&mdash;learn this&mdash;I am the child of Le Gros Guillem.
Have you ever heard of the Gros Guillem?&quot; she
asked in a tone of triumph, like the blast of a victor&#39;s
trumpet.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean lowered his staff, and looked steadily at her.
His brows were contracted, his lips were set firm.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
&quot;So!&quot; he said, after a pause. &quot;The daughter of
Gros Guillem?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye&mdash;have you heard of him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I have heard of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And of the del&#39; Peyras who ever heard?&quot; asked
the girl with mockery and scorn, and snapped her
fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;God be thanked!&mdash;of the del&#39; Peyras you
have never heard as of the Gros Guillem.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The grapes&mdash;the grapes are sour!&quot; scoffed the
girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder at nothing you have done,&quot; said the
boy sternly, &quot;since you have told me whence you
come. Of the thorn&mdash;thorns; of the nettle&mdash;stings;
of the thistle&mdash;thistles&mdash;all after their kind. No!
God be praised!&quot; The boy took off his cap and
looked up. &quot;The Gros Guillem and my father,
Ogier del&#39; Peyra, are not to be spoken of in one sentence
here, nor will be from the White Throne on the
Day of Doom.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Looking steadily at the girl seething with anger,
with mortified pride, and with desire to exasperate
him, he said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should never have thought that you sprang
from the Gros Guillem. The likeness must be in the
heart, it is not in the face.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you seen my father?&quot; asked the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have never seen him, but I have heard of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
&quot;What have you heard?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That he is very tall and spider-like in build;
they call him &#39;le gros&#39; in jest, for he is not stout, but
very meagre. He has long hands and feet, and a long
head with red hair, and pale face with sunspots, and
very faint blue eyes, under thick red brows. That
is what I am told Le Gros Guillem is like. But
you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Describe me&mdash;go on!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot; answered Jean. &quot;There is no need. You
see yourself every day in the glass. When there is
no glass you look at yourself in the water; when no
water, you look at yourself in your nails.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When there is no water, I look at myself in your
eyes, and see a little brown creature there&mdash;that is me.
<i>Allons!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She began to laugh. Much of her bad temper
had flown; she was a girl of rapidly changing moods.</p>

<p class="indent">It was true that she was mirrored in Jean del&#39;
Peyra&#39;s eyes. He was observing her attentively. Never
before had he seen so handsome a girl, with olive,
transparent skin, through which the flush of colour
ran like summer lightning in a summer cloud&mdash;such
red lips, such rounded cheek and chin; such an easy,
graceful figure! The magnificent burnished black
hair was loose and flowing over her shoulders; and
her eyes!&mdash;they had the fire of ten thousand flints
lurking in them and flashing out at a word.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
&quot;How come you here?&quot; asked Jean, in a voice
less hard and in a tone less indifferent than before.
&quot;This place, La Roque Gageac, is not one for a
daughter of Le Gros Guillem. Here we are French.
At Domme they are English, and that is the place for
your father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said the girl in reply, &quot;among us women
French or English are all the same. We are both and
we are neither. I suppose you are French?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I am French.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And a Bishop&#39;s man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I live on our own land&mdash;Del Peyraland, at Ste.
Soure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I am with my aunt here. My father considers
Domme a little too rough a place for a girl.
He has sent me hither. At the gates they did not
ask me if I were French or English. They let me
through, but not my father&#39;s men. They had to ride
back to Domme.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He cannot come and see you here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl laughed. &quot;If he were to venture here,
they would hang him&mdash;not give him half an hour to
make his peace with Heaven!&mdash;hang him&mdash;hang him
as a dog!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So!&mdash;and you are even proud of such a
father!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So!&mdash;and even I am proud to belong to one
whose name is known. I thank my good star I do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
not belong to a nobody of whom none talk, even as an
Ogier del&#39; Peyra.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are proud of your father&mdash;of Le Gros Guillem!&quot;
exclaimed Jean; and now his brow flushed
with anger, and his eye sparkled. &quot;Proud of that
<i>routier</i> and <i>rouffien</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who is the scourge, the curse of
the country round! Proud of the man that has desolated
our land, has made happy wives into wailing
widows, and glad children into despairing orphans;
who has wrecked churches, and drunk&mdash;blaspheming
God at the time&mdash;out of the gold chalices; who has
driven his sword into the bowels of his own Mother
Country, and has scorched her beautiful face with his
firebrands! I know of Le Gros Guillem&mdash;who does
not?&mdash;know of him by the curses that are raised by
his ill deeds, the hatred he has sown, the vows of vengeance
that are registered&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

A <i>routier</i>, a brigand who harassed the roads; a <i>rouffien</i>, a

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which he laughs at,&quot; interrupted Noémi.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which he laughs at now,&quot; pursued the boy angrily,
and anger gave fluency to his tongue. &quot;But do
you not suppose that a day of reckoning will arrive?
Is Heaven deaf to the cries of the sufferers? Is Humanity
all-enduring, and never likely to revolt&mdash;and,
when she does, to exact a terrible revenge? The
labourer asks for naught but to plough his land in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
peace, the merchant nothing but to be allowed to go
on his journey unmolested, the priest has no higher
desire than to say his Mass in tranquillity. And all
this might be but for Le Gros Guillem and the like
of him. Let the English keep their cities and their
provinces; they belong to them by right. But is Le
Gros Guillem English? Was Perducat d&#39;Albret English?
What of Le petit Mesquin? of the Archpriest?
of Cervolle? Were they English? Are those real
English faces that we fear and hate? Are they not
the faces of our own countrymen, who call themselves
English, that they may plunder and murder their
fellow-countrymen and soak with blood and blast
with fire the soil that reared them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi was somewhat awed by his vehemence, but
she said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather something to be talked about than a
nothing at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wrong, utterly wrong!&quot; said Jean. &quot;Rather be
the storm that bursts and wrecks all things than be
still beneficent Nature in her order which brings to
perfection? Any fool can destroy; it takes a wise
man to build up. You&mdash;you fair and gay young
spirit, tell me have you ever seen that of which you
speak so lightly, of which you jest as if it were
a matter of pastime? Have you gone tripping
after your father, treading in his bloody footprints,
holding up your skirts lest they should touch the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
festering carcases on either side the path he has
trod?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; answered the girl, and some of the colour
went out of her face, leaving it the finest, purest olive
in tint.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then say no more about your wish to have a
name as a <i>routier</i> and to be the terror of the countryside,
till you have experienced what it is that terrorises
the land.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One must live,&quot; said Noémi.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One may live by helping others to live&mdash;as does
the peasant, and the artisan, as the merchant; or by
destroying the life of others&mdash;as does the <i>routier</i> and
the vulgar robber,&quot; answered Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Noémi caught his wrist and drew him aside
under an archway. Her quick eye had seen the castellan
coming that way; he had not been in the castle
in the face of the rock, but in the town; and he was
now on his way back. He would find the means of
ascent broken, and must repair it before reaching his
eyrie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is the fool now?&quot; said Jean del&#39; Peyra.
&quot;You, who were knocking away the steps below you,
calculating that if you destroyed that stair, you could
still descend by the custodian&#39;s rope and windlass.
See&mdash;he was not there. You would have been
fast as a prisoner till the ladder was restored; and
small bones would have been made of you, Gros
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
Guillem&#39;s daughter, for playing such a prank as
that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Unseen they watched the man storming, swearing,
angrily gathering up the pegs and wedges and the
hammer, and ascending the riskful flight of steps to
replace the missing pieces of wood in their sockets,
and peg them firmly and sustainingly with their
wedges.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What you did in your thoughtlessness, that your
father and the like of him do in their viciousness, and
do on a grander scale,&quot; said Jean. &quot;They are knocking
away the pegs in the great human ladder, destroying
the sower with his harvest, the merchant with his
trade, the mason, the carpenter, the weaver with their
crafts, the scholar with his learning, the man of God
with his lessons of peace and goodwill. And at last
Le Gros Guillem and such as he will be left alone,
above a ruined world on the wreckage of which he
has mounted, to starve, when there is nothing more to
be got, because the honest getters have all been struck
down. Who is the fool now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have done!&quot; said the girl impatiently. &quot;You
have moralised enough&mdash;you should be a clerk!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are all made moralists when we see honesty
trampled under foot. Well for you, Noémi, with your
light head and bad heart&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My bad heart!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye, your bad heart. Well for you that you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
a harmless girl and not a boy, or you would have followed
quick in your father&#39;s steps and built yourself
up as hateful a name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I, a harmless girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, a harmless girl. Your hands are feeble, and
however malicious your heart, you can do none a mischief,
save your own self.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are sure of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercifully it is so. The will to hurt and ruin
may be present, but you are weak and powerless to do
the harm you would.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is a woman so powerless?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She ran up a couple of steps, caught him by the
shoulders, stooped, and kissed him on the lips, before
he was aware what she was about to do.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say that again! A woman is weak! A woman
cannot ravage and burn, and madden and wound&mdash;not
with a sword and a firebrand, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stooped. The boy was bewildered&mdash;his pulses
leaping, his eye on fire, his head reeling. She kissed
him again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These are her weapons!&quot; said Noémi. &quot;Who
is the fool now?&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="center">THE WOLVES OUT.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jean del&#39; Peyra</span> was riding home, a distance of
some fifteen miles from La Roque Gageac. His way
led through forests of oak clothing the slopes and
plateau of chalk. The road was bad&mdash;to be more
exact, there was no road; there was but a track.</p>

<p class="indent">In times of civil broil, when the roads were beset
by brigands, travellers formed or found ways for themselves
through the bush, over the waste land, away
from the old and neglected arteries of traffic. The
highways were no longer kept up&mdash;there was no one
to maintain them in repair, and if they were sound
no one would travel on them who could avoid them
by a détour, when exposed to be waylaid, plundered,
carried off to a dungeon, and put to ransom.</p>

<p class="indent">To understand the condition of affairs, a brief
sketch of the English domination in Guyenne is
necessary.</p>

<p class="indent">By the marriage of Eleanor, daughter and heiress
of William X., Earl of Poitou and Duke of Aquitaine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
with Henry of Anjou, afterwards Henry II. of
England, in 1152, the vast possessions of her family
were united to those of the Angevin house, which
claimed the English crown.</p>

<p class="indent">By this union the house of Anjou suddenly rose
to be a power, superior to that of the French crown
on the Gaulish soil, which it cut off entirely from the
mouths of the Seine and the Loire, and nipped between
its Norman and Aquitanian fingers. The natives
of the South&mdash;speaking their own language, of
different race, aspirations, character, from those in
the North&mdash;had no traditional attachment to the
French throne, and no ideal of national concentration
about it into one great unity. Here and there,
dotted about as islets in the midst of the English possessions
in the South, were feudal or ecclesiastical
baronies, or townships, that were subject immediately
to the French crown, and exempt from allegiance
to the English King; and these acted as germs,
fermenting in the country, and gradually but surely
influencing the minds of all, and drawing all to the
thought that for the good of the land it were better
that it should belong to France than to England.
Such was the diocese and county of Sarlat. This had
belonged to a monastic church founded in the eighth
century, but it had been raised to an episcopal see in
1317, and had never wavered in its adherence to the
French interest. Sarlat was not on the Dordogne,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
but lay buried, concealed in the depths of oak-woods,
accessible only along narrow defiles commanded at
every point by rocky headlands; and the key to the
episcopal city was La Roque Gageac, the impregnable
fortress and town on the pellucid, rippling Dordogne&mdash;the
town cramped to the steep slope, the
castle nestling into an excavation in the face of the
abrupt scarp.</p>

<p class="indent">Nearly opposite La Roque stood an insulated
block of chalk, with precipices on all sides, and to
secure this, in 1280, Philip III. of France built on it
a free town, exempt from all taxes save a trifling
house-charge due to himself; which town he hoped
would become a great commercial centre, and a focus
whence French influence might radiate to the south
of the Dordogne. Unhappily the importance of
Domme made it a prize to be coveted by the English,
and in 1347 they took it. They were expelled in
1369, but John Chandos laid siege to it in 1380 and
took it again, and from that date it remained uninterruptedly
in their hands till the end of the English
power in Aquitaine. For three hundred years
had Guyenne pertained to the English crown, many
of the towns and most of the nobility had no aspirations
beyond serving the Leopards. The common
people were supremely indifferent whether the Fleur-de-lys
or the Leopards waved above them, so long as
they were left undisturbed. It was precisely because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
they had not the boon of tranquillity afforded them
by subjection to the English that they turned at
last with a sigh of despair to the French. But
it was to the Leopards, the hereditary coat of Guyenne,
that they looked first, and it was only when
the Leopard devoured them that they inclined to the
Lilies.</p>

<p class="indent">The reason for this general dissatisfaction and
alienation was the violence of the nobility, and the
freebooters, who professed to act for the Crown of
England, and to have patents warranting them to act
licentiously. These men, caring only for their own
interests, doing nothing to advance the prosperity of
the land, used their position, their power, to undermine
and ruin it. They attacked the towns whether
under the English or French allegiance&mdash;that mattered
nothing&mdash;and forced the corporations to enter
into compacts with them, whereby they undertook to
pay them an annual subvention, not to ensure protection,
but merely to escape pillage. But even these
<i>patis</i>, as they were called, were precarious, and did
not cover a multitude of excuses for infringement of
the peace. If, for instance, a merchant of Sarlat was
in debt to a man of Domme, the latter appealed to his
feudal master, who, in spite of any <i>patis</i> granted,
swooped down on such members of the community of
Sarlat as he could lay hold of, and held them in durance
till not only was the debt paid, but he was himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
indemnified for the trouble he had taken in obtaining
its discharge.</p>

<p class="indent">If these things were done in the green tree, what
in the dry?</p>

<p class="indent">In addition to the feudal seigneurs in their castles,
ruling over their seigneuries, and nominally amenable
to the English crown, there were the <i>routiers</i>, captains
of free companies, younger sons of noble houses,
bastards, runaway prisoners: any idle and vicious rascal
who could collect thirty men of like kidney constituted
himself a captain, made for himself and his
men a habitation by boring into the limestone or
chalk rock, in an inaccessible position, whence he
came down at pleasure and ravaged and robbed,
burned and murdered indiscriminately, the lands and
houses and persons of those, whether French or English,
who had anything to attract his greed, or who
had incurred his resentment.</p>

<p class="indent">When Arnaud Amanieu, Sire d&#39;Albret, transferred
his allegiance from the English King to the King of
France, he was seen by Froissart in Paris, sad of countenance,
and he gave this as his reason: &quot;Thank God!
I am well in health, but my purse was fuller when I
warred on behalf of the King of England. Then
when we rode on adventures, there were always some
rich merchants of Toulouse, of Condom, of La Réole,
or Bergerac for us to squeeze. Every day we got
some spoil to stuff our superfluities and jollities&mdash;alack!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
now all is dead and dull.&quot; That was the saying
of a great Prince, whom the King of France delighted
to honour. Now hear the words of a common
<i>routier</i>: &quot;How rejoiced were we when we rode abroad
and captured many a rich prior or merchant, or a
train of mules laden with Brussels cloths, or furs from
the fair of Landit, or spices from Bruges, or silks from
Damascus! All was ours, and we ransomed men at
our good pleasure. Every day fresh spoil. The villages
purveyed to us, and the rustics brought us corn,
flour, bread, litter, wines, meat, and fowl; we were
waited on as kings, we were clothed as princes, and
when we rode abroad the earth quaked before us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In this terrible time agriculture languished, trade
was at a standstill. Bells were forbidden to be rung
in churches from vespers till full day, lest they should
direct the freebooters to villages that they might ravage.
The towns fortified themselves, the villagers
converted their churches into castles, and surrounded
them with moats. Children were planted on all high
points to keep watch, and give warning at the flash of
a helmet. Wretched peasants spent their nights in
islands in mid-river or in caves underground.</p>

<p class="indent">No one who has not visited the country swept and
re-swept by these marauders can have any conception
of the agony through which the country passed. It is
furrowed, torn, to the present day by the picks of the
ruffians who sought for themselves nests whence they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
might survey the land and swoop down on it, but
above all by the efforts of the tortured to hide themselves&mdash;here
burrowing underground like moles in
mid-field, there boring out chambers in clefts of the
rock, there constructing for themselves cabins in the
midst of mosquito-haunted marshes, and there, again,
ensconcing themselves in profound depths of trackless
forests.</p>

<p class="indent">As Jean del&#39; Peyra rode along, he shook his head
and passed his hand over his face, as though to free it
from cobwebs that had gathered about his eyes and
were irritating him. But these were no spider-threads:
what teased and confused him were other
fibres, spun by that brown witch, Noémi.</p>

<p class="indent">He was angry, indignant with her, but his anger
and indignation were, as it were, trowel and prong
that dug and forked the thoughts of her deep into his
mind. He thought of her standing before him, quivering
with wrath, the fire flashing and changing hue
in her opalescent brown eyes, and the hectic flame
running through her veins and tinging cheek and
brow. He thought of her voice, so full of tone, so
flexible, as opalescent in melodious change as her eyes
iridescent of light.</p>

<p class="indent">That she&mdash;she with such a smooth face, such slim
fingers&mdash;should talk of crime as a joke, exult over the
misery of her fellows! A very leopard in litheness
and in beauty, and a very leopard in heart.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
Jean del&#39; Peyra&#39;s way led down the head stream of
the Lesser Beune. The valley was broad&mdash;one level
marsh&mdash;and, in the evening, herons were quivering in
it, stooping to pick up an eft or a young roach.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! you vile creature!&quot; sang forth Jean, as a
black hare rose on his left and darted past him into
the wood. &quot;Prophet of evil! But what else in these
untoward times and in this evil world can one expect
but omens of ill?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The track by which Jean descended emerged from
the dense woods upon open ground. As the Beune
slid to a lower level, it passed under precipices of rock,
about a hundred or a hundred and fifty feet high;
and these cliffs, composed of beds of various softness,
were horizontally channelled, constituting terraces,
each terrace unsupported below, or rather thrown forward
over a vault. Moreover, there was not one of
these platforms of rock that was not tenanted. In
the evening, peasants returning from their work were
ascending to their quarters by scrambling up the rocks
where vertical, by means of notches cut in the stone,
into which they thrust their hands and feet. Where
the ledges overhung, the men were drawn up by ropes
to the platforms above.</p>

<p class="indent">But not only was this the case with men, but with
their oxen. Jean passed and saluted a farmer who
was in process of placing his beasts in a position of
security for the night. His wife was above, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
rock, and was working a windlass by means of which
an ox was being gradually lifted from the ground by
broad bands passed under its belly, and so was raised
to the height of some thirty feet, where the beast, accustomed
to this proceeding, quickly stepped on to a
narrow path cut in the rock, and walked to its stable,
also rock-hewn in the face of the cliff.</p>

<p class="indent">In another place was a woman with her children
closing up the opening of a grotto that was level with
the soil. This was effected by a board which fitted
into a rebate in the rock, and then the woman, after
putting her children within, heaped stones and sods
against the board to disguise it; and when this had
been done to her satisfaction, she crawled in by a hole
that had been left for the purpose, and by a cord
pulled after her a bunch of brambles that served to
plug and disguise this hole.</p>

<p class="indent">Bitterness welled up in the heart of Jean as he noticed
all these efforts made by the poor creatures to
place themselves in security during the hours of
darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Fontaineya!&quot; called Jean to the farmer who
was superintending the elevation of his second ox.
&quot;How goes the world with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bad, but might be worse&mdash;even as with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With me things are not ill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whence come you, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From La Roque.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
&quot;Aha! Not from Ste. Soure?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I have been from home these fourteen days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then do not say things are not ill with you till
you have been home,&quot; remarked the peasant dryly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has happened?&quot; asked Jean, his blood
standing still with alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The wolves have been hunting!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What wolves?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The red. Le Gros Guillem.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has been to Ste. Soure?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has been to where Ste. Soure <i>was</i>.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="center">IN NOMINE BEELZEBUB.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was strange. The first recoil wave of the shock
caused by this tidings broke into foam and fury
against Noémi. Jean del&#39; Peyra did not think of his
loss, of the ruin of his home, of the sufferings of his
people, but of Noémi laughing, making light of these
things.</p>

<p class="indent">It was strange. Instead of striking spurs into his
steed&#39;s flank and galloping forward to the scene of
desolation, involuntarily, unconsciously, he turned his
horse&#39;s head round, so that he faced the far-off Gageac,
and with set teeth and flashing eye and lowering
brow, wiped his lips with the sleeve of his right arm&mdash;wiped
them not once nor twice, but many times as to
wipe off and wipe away for ever the sensation, the
taint, the fire that had been kindled there by the
kisses he had received.</p>

<p class="indent">Then only did he wheel his horse about and gallop&mdash;where
galloping was possible&mdash;down the valley of the
Beune. The Beune is a stream rather than a river,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
that flows into the Vézère. It has a singular quality:
so charged are the waters with lime that they petrify,
or rather encrust, the roots of all plants growing in
the morass through which they flow, by this means
forming dams for itself, which it gradually surmounts
to form others. The original bottom of the ravine
must be at a considerable depth under the flat marsh
of living and dead waterweed, of active and paralysed
marsh plants, of growing and petrified moss that encumbers
it, and extends to the very faces of the rocks.</p>

<p class="indent">At the present day a road laboriously constructed,
and where it crossed the valley perpetually sinking
and perpetually renovated, gives access to the springs
of the Beune. It was not so in the fifteenth century.
Then a track lay along the sides where the ground
was solid&mdash;that is to say, where it consisted of rubble
from the hill-sides; but where the marsh reached the
abrupt walls of cliff, there the track clambered up the
side of the valley, and surmounted the escarpments.</p>

<p class="indent">Consequently progress in former ages in that part
was not as facile as it is at present.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean was constrained speedily to relax the pace at
which he was proceeding.</p>

<p class="indent">As long as he was in forest and rough place he
was secure: the brigands did not care to penetrate, at
all events at nightfall, into out-of-the-way places, and
where they might fall into ambuscades.</p>

<p class="indent">It was otherwise when he came to where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
Beune distilled from its sponge of moss into the
rapidly flowing Vézère. Here was a great amphitheatre
of scarped sides of rock, all more or less
honeycombed with habitations and refuges.</p>

<p class="indent">Here, on his left-hand side, looking north, scowling
over the pleasant and smiling basin of the Vézère,
was the castle of the Great Guillem. It consisted of
a range of caves or overhanging ledges of rock, the
faces of which had been built up with walls, windows,
and crenelations, and a gate-house had been constructed
to command the only thread of a path by
which the stronghold could be reached.</p>

<p class="indent">From this castle watch was kept, and no one could
ascend or descend the valley unobserved. Jean was
on the same bank as the fortress of Guillem, though
considerably above it. He must cross the river, and
to do this, ascend it to the ford.</p>

<p class="indent">He moved along carefully and watchfully. The
dusk of evening concealed his movements, and he was
able, unnoticed, or at all events unmolested, to traverse
the Vézère and pass on the further side of the river
down stream, in face of the strong place of Le Gros
Guillem.</p>

<p class="indent">A couple of leagues further down was a hamlet, or
rather village, called Le Peuch Ste. Soure, clustered
at the foot of a cliff or series of cliffs that rose out of
a steep incline of rubble. The houses were gathered
about a little church dedicated to Ste. Soure. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
white crags above were perforated with habitations.
A scent of fire was in the air, and in the gloaming
Jean could see the twinkle of sparks running, dying
out, reappearing where something had been consumed
by flames, but was still glowing in places, and sparks
were wandering among its ashes. As he drew nearer
he heard wailing, and with the wailing voices raised
in cursing.</p>

<p class="indent">A sickness came on the lad&#39;s heart; he knew but
too well what this all signified&mdash;desolation to many
homes, ruin to many families.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold! Who goes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is I&mdash;Jean del&#39; Peyra.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;pass. You will find your father. He is
with the Rossignols.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean rode on. There were tokens of confusion on
all sides. Here a rick was smouldering, and there a
house was wrecked, the door broken, and the contents
of the dwelling thrown out in the way before it.
Pigs that had escaped from their styes ran about rooting
after food, and dogs snarled and carried off fragments
of meat. A few peasants were creeping about
timidly, but, alarmed at the appearance in their midst
of a man on horseback, and unable in the dusk to distinguish
who he was, they fled to conceal themselves.
Jean leaped from his horse, hitched it up, and strode
on, with beating heart and bounding pulse, to a house
which he knew was that of the Rossignols.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
He entered the door. A light shone through the
low window. It was characteristic of the times that
in every village and hamlet the windows&mdash;the only
windows&mdash;were so turned inwards on a street or yard
that they revealed no light at night when a candle
was kindled or a fire burned brightly on the hearth,
lest the light should betray to a passing marauder the
presence of a house which might be looted.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean bowed his head and entered at the low door.
The fire was flashing in the large open chimney. A
bundle of vine faggots had been thrown on, and the
light filled the chamber with its orange glare.</p>

<p class="indent">By this light Jean saw a bed with a man lying on
it; and a woman crying, beating her head and uttering
wild words&mdash;her children clinging to her, sobbing,
frightened, imploring her to desist.</p>

<p class="indent">Erect, with a staff in his hand, stood a grey-headed,
thick-bearded man, with dark eyes shadowed
under heavy brows.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned sharply as the lad entered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hah! Jean, you are back. It is well. It is well
you were not here this day earlier. If they had taken
you, there would have been a heavy ransom to pay, by
the Holy Napkin of Cadouin! And how to redeem
those already taken I know not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has been done to Rossignol, father?&quot;
asked Jean, going to the bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What will be done to the rest unless the ransom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
be forthcoming in fourteen days. They have left him
thus, to show us what will be the fate of the seven
others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seven others, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye; they have taken off seven of the men of
Ste. Soure. We must find the ransom, or they will
send them back to us, even after the fashion of this
poor man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he dead, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man lying on the bed moved, and, raising
himself on his elbow, said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Young master, I am worse than dead. Dead, I
would be no burden. Living, I shall drag my darlings
underground with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the woman, frantic with grief, turned on her
knees, threw up her hands, and uttered a stream of
mingled prayer and imprecation&mdash;prayer to Heaven
and prayer to Hell; to Heaven to blast and torture
the destroyers of her house, to Hell to hear her cry
if Heaven were deaf. It was not possible for Jean to
learn details from her in this fury and paroxysm.
He drew his father outside the door and shut it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father,&quot; said he, &quot;tell me what has taken place.
It was Le Gros Guillem, was it not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye, Le Gros Guillem. We did not know he
was in his church, we thought he was in Domme, and
would be occupied there, and we gave less heed and
kept less close watch. You see there were, we knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
or supposed, but three men in the church, and so long
as they were supplied with food and wine, we had
little fear. But we had not reckoned right on Guillem.
He came back in the night with a score of men,
and they rushed down on us; they crossed the river
during the day, when the men were in the fields and
about their work, and the women and children alone
in the houses. When it was seen that the <i>routiers</i>
were coming, then the church bell was rung, but we
had little or no time to prepare; they were on us and
in every house, breaking up the coffers, sacking the
closets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did they get into Le Peuch, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; when we heard the bell, then we shut the
gates and barricaded; but there were not four men in
the castle, myself included. What could we do? We
could only look on and witness the destruction; and
one of the men in the castle was Limping Gaston,
who was no good at all; and another was Blind
Bartholomew, who could not see an enemy and distinguish
him from a friend. When the men in the
fields heard the bell, they came running home, to
save what might be saved; but it was too late. The
ruffians were there robbing, maltreating, and they
took them as they came on&mdash;seven of them&mdash;and
bound their hands behind them, and these they have
carried off. They have burned the stack of corn of
Jean Grano. The wife of Mussidan was baking.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
They have carried off all her loaves, and when she
entreated them to spare some they swore at another
word they would throw one of her babes into the
oven. They have ransacked every house, and spoiled
what they could not carry away. And the rest of the
men, when they saw how those who came near Ste.
Soure were taken, fled and hid themselves. Some of
the women, carrying their children, came up the steep
slope before the <i>routiers</i> arrived, and we received
them into the castle; but others remained, hoping to
save some of their stuff, and not thinking that the
enemy was so nigh. So they were beaten to tell where
any money was hidden. The wife of Drax&mdash;she has
had her soles so cut with vine-rods that she cannot
walk; but she was clever&mdash;she told where some old
Roman coins were hid in a pot, and not where were
her silver livres of French money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How long were they here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot tell, Jean. It seemed a century. It
may have been an hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They have carried off seven men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, to Domme, or to the church. I cannot say
where. And we must send the ransom in fourteen
days, or Le Gros Guillem swears he will return them
all to us tied on the backs of mules, treated as he has
treated Rossignol. He said he left us Rossignol as a
refresher.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what has he done to Rossignol?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
&quot;Hamstrung him. He can never walk again.
From his thighs down he is powerless&mdash;helpless as a
babe in arms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean uttered an exclamation of horror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father, there must be an end put to these
things! We must rouse the country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must pay the ransom first, or all those poor
fellows will be sent back to us like as is Rossignol.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us go into the house,&quot; said Jean, and threw
open the door. &quot;We must do something for these
unhappy creatures.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye,&quot; said his father, &quot;and something must be
done to save seven other houses from being put in the
same condition. Where shall we get the money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will consider that presently&mdash;first to this
man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A strange spectacle met their eyes when they re-entered
the house of the Rossignols.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman had suspended something dark to a
crook in the ceiling, had brought glowing ashes from
the hearth, and had placed them in a circle on the
floor below this dark object, and had spilled tallow
over the red cinders, and the tallow having melted,
had become ignited, so that a flicker of blue flame
shot about the ring, and now and then sent up a jet
of yellow flame like a long tongue that licked the
suspended object. The woman held back her children,
and in one hand she had a long steel pin or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
skewer, with a silver head to it, wherewith she had
been wont to fasten up her hair. She had withdrawn
this from her head, and all her black hair was flowing
about her face and shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See!&quot; yelled she, and the glitter of her eyes was
terrible. &quot;See! it is the heart of Le Gros Guillem.
I will punish him for all he has done to me. This
for my man&#39;s nerves that he has cut.&quot; She made a
stab with her pin at the suspended object, which Jean
and his father now saw was a bullock&#39;s heart. &quot;This
for all the woe he has brought on me!&quot; She stabbed
again. &quot;See, see, my children, how he twists and
tosses! Ha! ha! Gros Guillem, am I paining you?
Do you turn to escape me? Do I strike spasms of
terror into your heart? Ha! ha! the Rossignol is a
song-bird, but her beak is sharp.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean caught the woman&#39;s hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stand back!&quot; he cried, &quot;this is devilry. This
will bring you to the stake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What care I&mdash;so long as I torture and stab and
burn Le Gros Guillem! And who will denounce me
for harming him? Will the Church&mdash;which he has
pillaged? Will you&mdash;whom he has robbed? Let me
alone&mdash;see&mdash;see how the flames burn him! Ha! ha!
Le Gros Guillem! Am I swinging you! Dance,
dance in fire! Swing, swing in anguish! For my
children this!&quot; and she stabbed at the heart again.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman was mad with despair and hate and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
terror. Jean stood back, put his hand to his mouth,
and said with a groan&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My God! would Noémi were here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In Nomine Beelzebub!&quot; shrieked the woman,
and struck the heart down into the melted flaming
fat on the floor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="center">RAISING THE RANSOM.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A heavy</span> sum of money had to be raised, and
that within a fortnight.</p>

<p class="indent">The Del&#39; Peyra family was far from wealthy. It
owned a little seigneurie, Ste. Soure, little else. It
took its name from the rocks among which it had its
habitation, from the rocks among which its land lay
in brown patches, and from which a scanty harvest
was reaped. Only in the valley where there was alluvial
soil were there pastures for cattle, and on the
slopes vineyards whence wine could be expressed.
The arable land on the plateaus above the valley of
the Vézère was thin and poor enough. A little grain
could be grown among the flints and chips of chalk,
but it was scanty and poor in quality. If the territories
owned by the Del&#39; Peyras had been extensive,
then vastness of domain might have compensated for
its poor quality. But such was not the case.</p>

<p class="indent">The Castle of Le Peuch above Ste. Soure was but
small; it consisted of a cluster of buildings leaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
against the upright cliff at the summit of a steep incline.
This natural glacis of rubble, at an inclination
so rapid that the ascent was a matter of difficulty,
was in itself a considerable protection to it. The
castle could not be captured at a rush, for no rush
could be made up a slope which was surmountable
only with loss of wind. But supposing the main
buildings were stormed, still the inhabitants were
sure of escape, for from the roof of the castle they
could escalade the precipices to a series of chambers
scooped out of the rock, at several successive elevations,
each stage being defendable, and only to be
surmounted by a ladder. The castle itself was hardly
so big as a modern farmhouse. It consisted of but
three or four small chambers, one of which served
as kitchen and hall. Le Peuch was not a place to
stand much of a siege; it was rather what was called
in those times a <i>place-forte</i>, a stronghold in which
people could take temporary refuge from the freebooters
who swept the open country, and had no
engines for the destruction of walls, nor time to expend
in a regular siege. To the poor at that period,
the church-tower was the one hold of security, where
they put their chests in which were all their little
treasures; and it was one of the bitterest complaints
against a rapacious Bishop of Rodez, that he levied a
fee for his own pocket on all these cypress and
ashen boxes confided to the sanctuary of the parish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
church. When the signal was given that an enemy
was in sight, then men and women crowded to the
church and barred its doors. A visitor to the Périgord
will this day see many a village church which
bears tokens of having been a fortress. The lowest
storey is church; the floors above are so contrived as
to serve as places of refuge, with all appliances for a
residence in them. When Louis VII. was ravaging
the territories of his indocile vassal, the Count of
Champagne, he set fire to the church of the little
town of Vitry, in which all the citizens, their wives
and children, had taken refuge, and thirteen hundred
persons perished in the flames. Such was war in the
Middle Ages. When Henry V. of England was entreated
not to burn the towns and villages through
which he passed, &quot;Bah!&quot; said he, &quot;would you have
me eat my meat without mustard?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At Ste. Soure there was no church-tower, the
place of refuge of the villagers was Le Peuch; but
the attack of the marauders had been too sudden and
unexpected for them to reach it.</p>

<p class="indent">What was to be done? The ransom demanded for
the seven men was a hundred livres of Bergerac&mdash;that
is to say, a sum equivalent at the present time
to about one thousand nine hundred pounds. Unless
the men were redeemed, the Sieur of Le Peuch would
be ruined. No men would remain under his protection
when he could neither protect nor deliver them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
If he raised the sum, it must be at a ruinous rate,
that would impoverish him for years. He was
stunned with the magnitude of the disaster. There
was but a fortnight in which not only must he resolve
what to do, but have the money forthcoming.</p>

<p class="indent">After the first stupefaction was over, the old man&#39;s
heart was full of wrath.</p>

<p class="indent">Ogier del&#39; Peyra had been a peaceable man, a good
landlord, never oppressing his men, rather dull in
head and slow of thought, but right-minded and
straightforward. No little seigneur in all the district
was so respected. Perhaps it was for this reason
that his lands had hitherto been spared by the ravagers.
He was not one who had been a hot partisan
of the French and a fiery opponent of the English,
or rather of those who called themselves English.
He had wished for nothing so much as to remain
neutral.</p>

<p class="indent">But now Le Gros Guillem, who respected nothing
and nobody, had suddenly dealt him a staggering
blow from which he could hardly recover.</p>

<p class="indent">The effect when the first numbness was passed
was such as is often the case with dull men, slow to
move. Once roused and thoroughly exasperated, he
became implacable and resolute.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will recover our men,&quot; said Ogier to his son,
&quot;and then repay Guillem in his own coin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How shall we get the money?&quot; asked Jean.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
&quot;You must go to Sarlat, and see if any can be
procured there. See the Bishop; he may help.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly Jean del&#39; Peyra rode back a good part
of the way he had traced the previous day, but half-way
turned left to Sarlat instead of right to La
Roque.</p>

<p class="indent">The little city of Sarlat occupies a basin at the
juncture of some insignificant streams, and was
chosen by the first settlers&mdash;monks&mdash;as being in an
almost inaccessible position, when Périgord was covered
with forest. It was to be reached only through
difficult and tortuous glens. A flourishing town it
never was, and never could be, as it had no fertile
country round to feed it. It was a town that struggled
on&mdash;and drew its main importance from the fact
of its serving as a centre of French influence against
the all-pervading English power. It had another
source of life in that, being under the pastoral staff
instead of under the sword, it had better chance of
peace than had a town owing duty, military and
pecuniary, to a lay lord. The baron, if not on the
defensive, was not happy unless levying war, whereas
the ecclesiastical chief acted solely in the defensive.</p>

<p class="indent">The protection of the district ruled by the Bishop
of Sarlat was no easy or inexpensive matter, hemmed
in as it was by insolent seigneurs, who pretended to
serve the English when wronging their French neighbours.
Moreover the strong town of Domme, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
Dordogne, facing La Roque, was in the hands of the
English, and was garrisoned for them under the command
of the notorious Captain, Le Gros Guillem.</p>

<p class="indent">This man had his own fastness above the Vézère,
on the left bank, below the juncture of the Beune
with the river, a place called by the people &quot;L&#39;Eglise
de Guillem,&quot; in bitterness of heart and loathing, because
there, according to the popular belief, he had
his sanctuary in which he worshipped the devil.
Few, if any, of the peasants had been suffered to
enter this fortress, half-natural, half-artificial. Such
as had gained a closer view than could be obtained
from two hundred feet below by the river bank said
that it consisted of a series of chambers, partly natural,
scooped in the rock, and of a cavern of unknown depth
with winding entrance, that led, it was rumoured,
into the place of torment; and at the entrance, excavated
in a projecting piece of rock, was a holy-water
stoup such as is seen in churches. This, however,
it was whispered, was filled with blood, and Le
Gros Guillem, when he entered the cave to adore the
fiend, dipped his finger therein, and signed himself
with some cabalistic figure, of which none save he
knew the significance.</p>

<p class="indent">Between his own stronghold of L&#39;Eglise and the
walled town of Domme, Guillem was often on the
move.</p>

<p class="indent">Without much difficulty, Jean del&#39; Peyra obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
access to the Bishop, an amiable, frightened, and
feeble man, little suited to cope with the difficulties
of his situation. Jean told him the reason why he
had come.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But,&quot; said the Bishop, &quot;you are not my vassal.
I am not bound to sustain you.&quot; And he put his
hands to his head and pressed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that, Monseigneur; but you are French,
and so is my father; and we French must hold
together and help each other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must go to the French Governor of Guyenne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is he! What can he do? There is no
time to be lost to save the men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Bishop squeezed his head. &quot;I am unable to
do anything. A hundred livres of Bergerac&mdash;that is
a large sum. If it had been livres of Tours, it would
have been better. Here!&quot;&mdash;he signed to his treasurer&mdash;&quot;How
much have I? Is there anything in my
store?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing,&quot; answered the official. &quot;Monseigneur
has had to pay the garrison of La Roque, and all the
money is out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You hear what he says,&quot; said the Bishop dispiritedly.
&quot;I have nothing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then the seven men must be mutilated.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is too horrible! And the poor wives and children!
Ah! we are in terrible times. I pray the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
Lord daily to take me out of it into the Rest there
remains for the people of God; or, better still, to
translate me to another see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Monseigneur; but whilst we are here we
must do what we can for our fellows, and to save
them from further miseries.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is true, boy, very true. I wish I had
money. But it comes in in trickles and goes out in
floods. I will tell you what to do. Go to the Saint
Suaire at Cadouin and pray that the Holy Napkin
may help.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am afraid the help may come too late! The
Napkin, I hear, is slow in answering prayer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not if you threaten it with the Saint Suaire at
Cahors. Those two Holy Napkins are so near that
they are as jealous of each other as two handsome
girls; and if they met would tear each other as cats.
Tell the Saint Suaire at Cadouin that if you are not
helped at once you will apply to her sister at Cahors.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been told that it costs money to make the
Saint Suaire listen to one&#39;s addresses, and I want to
receive and not to pay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not much, not much!&quot; protested the Bishop.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Besides, Monseigneur,&quot; said the youth, &quot;there
might be delay while the two Holy Napkins were
fighting out the question which was to help us. And
then&mdash;to have such a squabble might not be conducive
to religion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
&quot;There is something in that,&quot; said the Bishop.
&quot;Oh, my head! my poor head!&quot; He considered a
while, and then with a sigh said&mdash;&quot;I&#39;ll indulge butter.
I will!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not understand, my lord.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll allow the faithful to eat butter in Lent, if
they will pay a few <i>sols</i> for the privilege. That will
raise a good sum.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but Lent is six months hence, and the men
will be mutilated in twelve days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Besides, I want the butter money for the cathedral,
which is a shabby building! What a world of
woe we live in!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monseigneur, can you not help me? Must seven
homes be rendered desolate for lack of a hundred
livres?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my head! it will burst! I have no money,
but I will do all in my power to assist you. Ogier
del&#39; Peyra is a good man, and good men are few. Go
to Levi in the Market Place. He is the only man in
Sarlat who grows rich in the general impoverishment.
He must help you. Tell him that I will guarantee
the sum. If he will give you the money, then he
shall make me pay a denier every time I light my fire
and warm my old bones at it. He can see my chimney
from his house, and whenever he notices smoke
rise from it, let him come in and demand his
denier.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
&quot;It will take a hundred years like that to clear
off the principal and meet the interest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Bishop raised his hands and clasped them
despairingly. &quot;I have done my utmost!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I am to carry the tidings to seven wives
that the Church cannot help them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;no! Try Levi with the butter-money. I
did desire to have a beautiful tower to my cathedral,
but seven poor homes is better than fine carving, and
I will promise him the butter-money. Try him with
that&mdash;if that fails, then I am helpless. My head!
my head! It will never rest till laid in the grave.
O sacred Napkins of Cadouin and Cahors! Take
care of yourselves and be more indulgent to us miserable
creatures, or I will publish a mandment recommending
the Napkin of Compiègne, or that of Besançon,
and then where will you be?&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="center">THE JEW.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jean del&#39; Peyra</span> left the Bishop&#39;s castle, which
stood on rising ground above the town, and was well
fortified against attack, and entered the city to find
Levi. The Jew lived in the little square before the
cathedral.</p>

<p class="indent">The Bishop might well say that his episcopal seat
was shabby, for the minster was small and rude in
structure, a building of the Romanesque period such
as delighted the monks to erect, and of which many
superb examples exist in Guyenne. The monastic
body at Sarlat had not been rich enough or sufficiently
skilled in building to give themselves as
stately a church as Souillac, Moissac, or Cadouin. It
consisted, like nearly every other sacred dwelling of
the period, of an oblong domed building, consisting
of three squares raised on arches surmounted by Oriental
cupolas, with an unfinished tower at the west
end. The visitor to Sarlat at the present day will see
a cathedral erected a century and more after the date
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
of our story, in a debased but not unpicturesque
style.</p>

<p class="indent">The Jew was not at home. His wife informed
Jean that he had gone to La Roque to gather in a
few <i>sols</i> that were owing to him there for money advanced
to needy personages, and that she did not expect
him home till the morrow. Christians were
ready enough to come to her husband for loans, but
were very reluctant to pay interest, and it cost Levi
much pains and vexation to extract what was his
due from those whom he had obliged. Accordingly
Jean remounted his horse, and rode over the hills
due south, in the direction of the Dordogne.</p>

<p class="indent">About halfway between Sarlat and La Roque, at
the highest point of the road, where the soil is too
thin even to sustain a growth of oak coppice, and produces
only juniper, Jean passed a singular congeries
of stones; it consisted of several blocks set on end,
forming an oblong chamber, and covered by an immense
slab, in which were numerous cup-like holes,
formed by the weather, or whence lumps of flint had
been extracted. It was a prehistoric tomb&mdash;a dolmen,
and went by the name of the Devil&#39;s Table. To the
present day, the women coming to the market at Sarlat
from La Roque rest on it, and if they put their
fish which they have to sell into the cups on the table,
are sure of selling them at a good price. Yet such
action is not thought to bring a blessing with it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
the money got by the sale of the fish thus placed in
the Devil&#39;s cups rarely does good to those who receive
it. The monument is now in almost total ruin: the
supports have been removed or are fallen, but at the
time of this tale it was intact.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean did not pay it any attention, but rode forwards
as hastily as he could on his somewhat fatigued
horse.</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching the little town of La Roque, Jean was
constrained to put up his horse outside the gates.
There was not a street in the place along which a
horse could go. The inhabitants partook of the nature
of goats, they scrambled from one house to another
when visiting their neighbours. Only by the
river-side was there a level space, and this was occupied
by strong walls as a protection against assault
from the water.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean inquired whether the Jew had been seen, and
where, and was told that he had been to several
houses, and was now in that of the Tardes. The family
of Tarde was one of some consequence in the little
place, and had its scutcheon over the door. It was
noble&mdash;about three other families in the place had the
same pretensions, or, to be more exact, right. Jean,
without scruple, went to the house of the Tardes and
asked for admission, and was at once ushered into the
little hall.</p>

<p class="indent">The Jew was there along with Jean and Jacques
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
Tarde, and they were counting money. To Del&#39; Peyra&#39;s
surprise, Noémi was also present and looking on.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean del&#39; Peyra gave his name, and asked leave to
have a word with the Jew. He stated the circumstances
openly. There was no need for concealment.
Le Gros Guillem had fallen on Ste. Soure, and after
committing the usual depredations, had carried off
seven men, and held them to ransom. The sum demanded
was a hundred Bergerac livres. Unless that
sum was produced immediately, the men would be
mutilated&mdash;hamstrung.</p>

<p class="indent">As Jean spoke, with bitterness welling up in his
heart, he looked straight in the eyes of Noémi. She
winced, changed colour, but resolved not to show that
she felt what was said, and returned Jean&#39;s look with
equal steadiness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you want the money?&quot; said the Jew. &quot;On
what security?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Bishop will grant an indulgence to eat butter
in Lent at a fee. That will raise more than is
required.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Bishop!&quot; Levi shook his head. &quot;You
Christians are not men of your word. You will promise
it&mdash;and never pay.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You lie, Jewish dog!&quot; said Jacques Tarde.
&quot;Have I not paid you what was owing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, you&mdash;but the Bishop!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he false?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
&quot;He may think it righteous to cheat the Jew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will give you what security you require that
the money be forthcoming,&quot; said Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will not the Christians eat butter without paying
for the dispensation?&quot; asked the Jew. &quot;If they
think that the butter-money is coming to me they
will not scruple. I do not like the security. The
Bishop is old; he may die before Lent; and then
what chance shall I have of getting my money? The
next Bishop will not allow butter, or, if he does, will
pocket the money it brings in. He will not be tied
by this Bishop&#39;s engagement. I will not have the
butter-money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you take a mortgage on Ste. Soure?&quot; asked
Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know. It is not on the Bishop&#39;s lands.
It is face to face with the stronghold of the big Guillem.
If I wanted to sell and realise, who would buy
in such proximity? Whom are you under? The
King of France? He is a long way off and his arm
is weak. No, I will not have a mortgage on Ste.
Soure. Besides, I am poor; I have no money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You lying cur!&quot; exclaimed Jacques Tarde; &quot;we
have paid you up all the capital lent us. We would
no longer have our blood sucked at twenty-eight per
cent, and we have sold the little land at Vézac to pay
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was easy land to sell,&quot; said the Jew. &quot;With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
Beynac Castle on one side and La Roque on the
other! But Ste. Soure&quot;&mdash;he shook his head. &quot;It is
under the claw of Guillem. He has but to put down
his hand from the Church and he scratches through
the roofs, and picks out all that he desires.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you refuse the Bishop&#39;s guarantee?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Jew looked furtively at the two Tardes and
at Jean and said&mdash;&quot;Who is to guarantee the Bishop?
On his lands he sees that I draw in my little <i>sols</i>, but
then I pay him for that, I pay heavily, and for that
heavy price he allows me to lend moneys and pick up
interests. But I do not pay the King of France to
ensure me against the Bishop. That is why I will not
let him be in debt to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our land is devoured by two evils,&quot; said Jacques
Tarde. &quot;The <i>routier</i> and Jew, and I do not know
which is worst! We shake ourselves, and kick out,
and for a moment are free, and then they settle on
us again. The carrion crow and the worm&mdash;and so
we die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Monsoo Tarde!&quot; answered Levi. &quot;Why do
you speak like this? You wished to build you a
grand house and paint it and carve and gild&mdash;and for
that must have moneys. Did I come and force you
to borrow of me my poor pennies? Did you not
come and beg me to furnish what you needed? I did
not say to you, &#39;Your old house is not worthy of a
Tarde. It is mean and not half fine enough for a fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
man like you!&#39; It was your own pride and vanity
sent you to me. And now, if I could find the moneys
would not this young gentleman bless me, and the
seven families I might be the saving of, call down the
benediction of the skies on me and mine? Here has
he come all the way from Ste. Soure to seek me, and
he is in despair because I am so poor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You poor! Levi! you thief!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am poor. I lay by grain on grain; and such
as you scatter and destroy. Why should I spend my
painfully gathered pennies to save some of your villains,
young Sir? What if there was a riot in Sarlat
as there was fifteen years ago&mdash;and the mob fell on
the Jews? How was it then? Did you not fire our
houses, and throw our children into the flames, and
run your pikes into the hearts of our mothers and
wives? You think we care for you after that! Let
your own Christian thieves hamstring their own brothers.
Why do you come to poor Levi to help you&mdash;to
Levi who is helpless among you, and is only suffered
to live because he is necessary to you? You cannot
do without him, as now&mdash;now, amidst the violences of
Le Gros Guillem!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you will not help me,&quot; said Jean, despairingly.
He had no thought for the wrongs endured
by the Jews, no thought for what made them a necessity,
no thought of the incongruity that while the
Church denounced usury, the usurers were only able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
to carry on their trade by the Pope and the prelates
extending their protection to them&mdash;for a consideration
in hard cash, paid annually.</p>

<p class="indent">Again Jean&#39;s eyes met those of Noémi; he was pale,
his brow clouded, his lips trembled, as though about
to address some words to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What would you say?&quot; she asked. &quot;Speak out.
I am not afraid to hear. Levi has been making my
father responsible for his bloodsucking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would,&quot; said Jean sullenly, &quot;I would to Heaven
you could come with me and see the work wrought at
Ste. Soure; and if after that you were able to laugh
and lightly talk of your father as a great man and one
to be proud of because he is in every mouth&mdash;then,
God help you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will come!&quot; answered the girl impulsively.
&quot;When? At once?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean looked at her incredulously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye!&quot; said she. &quot;Jacques Tarde has nothing to
engage him now that he has shaken off the horse-leech.
He will ride with me, and we will take another,
though I reckon my presence would suffice as a
protection. None will lay hands on the daughter of
Le Gros Guillem.&quot; She reared her head in pride.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be not so sure of that,&quot; said Jean. &quot;At Ste.
Soure they would tear you to pieces if they knew who
you were.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you&mdash;would look on and let it be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
&quot;No; on my lands, whilst under my protection,
you are safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Under your protection!&quot; jeered the girl! &quot;Bah!
If I stood among a thousand, and shouted, &#39;Ware!
Le Gros Guillem is on you!&#39; they would fly on all
sides as minnows when I throw a stone into the
water.&quot; She altered her tone and said: &quot;There, I go
to do good. I will see my father if he is at his
church, and I will whisper good thoughts unto him,
and get him to reduce the ransom. Now, will you
take me with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will trust yourself with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jacques Tarde shall come also. Let anyone dare
to touch Noémi! I will come. When shall we
start?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At once,&quot; answered Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So be it; at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="center">THE NEW COMPANION.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">One</span> of the strangest features of a strange time
was the manner in which families were broken up
and neighbours were at feud. The same individuals
shifted sides and were one day boozing together at
table and the next meeting in deadly conflict. Discord
was in families. In the house of Limeuil the
father was French, the son English; and the son was
English merely because he desired to turn his father
out of the ancestral heritage and lord it in his room.
Limeuil was stormed by the son, then retaken by the
father; now sacked by English troops, and then sacked
again by French troops, who cared nothing for the
national causes of France or England. Prevost de
la Force and Perducat d&#39;Albret had castles facing
each other on opposite sides of the Dordogne. Each
desired to draw some money out of the commercial
town of Bergerac on the plea that he was empowered
to protect it from the other. Accordingly, one called
himself French, the other English; and Perducat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
when it suited his convenience, after having been
English, became French. Domestic broils determined
the policy of the turbulent seigneurs. If they coveted
a bit of land, or a village, or a castle that belonged to
a brother or a cousin of one persuasion, they went
over to the opposed to supply them with an excuse
for falling on their kinsmen. The Seigneur de Pons,
because his marriage settlement with his wife did not
allow him sufficient liberty to handle her means,
turned French, and his wife threw open her gates to
the Duke of Lancaster. Whereupon the seigneur
fought the English, to whom he had formerly been
devoted, retook his town, and chastised his wife. The
man who was French to-day was English to-morrow,
and French again the day after. Some were very
weathercocks, turning with every wind, always with
an eye to their own advantage.</p>

<p class="indent">Consequently, families were much mixed up with
both parties. Unless a seigneur was out on a raid,
he would associate on terms of friendliness with the
very men whom he would hang on the next occasion.
Kinsfolk were in every camp. The seigneurs had
allies everywhere; but their kinsfolk were not always
their allies&mdash;were often their deadliest enemies.</p>

<p class="indent">The mother of Noémi was akin to the family of
Tarde. Indeed, her aunt was the mother of Jean
and Jacques, who were, accordingly, her first cousins.
The Tarde family were French; no one in Gageac
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
was English. By interest, by tradition, the place was
true to the Lilies.</p>

<p class="indent">A little way up the river, on the further side, was
Domme, which was held by the English. Noémi
passed from the English to the French town, and
nothing was thought of it that she was as much at
home with her cousins in La Roque Gageac as among
her mother&#39;s attendants at Domme. Even the young
Tardes might have gone to the market in the English
town and have returned unmolested.</p>

<p class="indent">The bullies of Guillem in like manner swaggered
where they listed, penetrated to Gageac, when there
was a dance or a drinking bout; and, so long as they
came unarmed, were allowed admittance.</p>

<p class="indent">No one could say whether there was peace or war.
There was a little of one and a little of the other.
Whenever a roysterer was weary of doing nothing,
he gathered his men together and made a raid; whenever
a captain wanted to pay his men, he plundered
a village. Otherwise, all went on tolerably quietly.
There was no marching across the country of great
bodies of armed men, no protracted sieges, no battles
in which whole hosts were engaged. But there was
incessant fear, there were small violences, there was
no certainty of safety. There was no central power
to control the wrong-doers, no justice to mete out
to them the reward of their deeds. When the lion
and the wolf and the bear are hungry, then they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
raven for food; when glutted, they lie down and
sleep. The barons and free captains and little seigneurs
were the lions, wolves, and bears that infested
Guyenne and Périgord. They were now on the alert
and rending, then ensued a period of quietude.</p>

<p class="indent">Little passed between Jean del&#39; Peyra and Noémi
on the way. She was mounted on a fresh horse, and
attended by two serving-men of the Tardes, as Jacques
and Jean could not accompany her, having duties
connected with the little town to discharge that day
which required their presence. Jean del&#39; Peyra was
on his fagged steed, and could not keep up with the
rest. Jean was not sanguine that the girl would prevail
with her father, but he was grateful that she
should make the attempt.</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching the point at the junction of the
Beune with the Vézère where the roads or tracks diverged,
the one to the Church of Guillem, the other
to the ford at Tayac, Noémi halted till Jean came up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to see my father,&quot; she said. &quot;I will
come on to Ste. Soure when I have his answer&mdash;but
I trust I shall bring to you your men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thank you,&quot; answered the lad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, Jean,&quot; said the girl; &quot;you will not think
so ill of me as you have done. Give me your
hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot think ill now of one who is doing her
best to relieve my father and me in a case of pressing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
necessity, and of saving seven families from worse
than death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He put out his hand and pressed hers, but without
cordiality. The hand he took was that of the daughter
of the scourge of the country. He could not forget
that; he touched the hand of the child of the
man who had brought desolation into the home of
the Rossignols.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi left the attendants with her horse at the
foot of the steep ascent that led to the Church of
Guillem.</p>

<p class="indent">The ascent was up a slope of crumbled chalk and
flints hardly held together by a little wiry grass, some
straggling pinks, and bushes of box and juniper.
The incline was as rapid as that of a Gothic house-roof.
Of path there was none, for every man who
scrambled up mounted his own way, and his footprints
sent shale and dust over the footprints of his
predecessor. The plateau through which the river
has sawn its way is some four hundred feet at the
highest point above the bed of the stream; in some
places the cliffs are not only perpendicular, they overhang.
They rise at once from the river that washes
their bases and undermines them, or from the alluvial
flats that have been formed by floods. This was not
the case at L&#39;Eglise Guillem. The stronghold of
Guillem occupied a terrace in the abrupt scarp where
it rose out of an immense slope of rubble, very much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
as at Ste. Soure, a little below it on the further bank.
Here, as there, the rubble slope was a protection as
great as a precipice. It was not as difficult to climb,
but it could not be climbed without those in the
stronghold being able to roll down rocks, discharge
weapons at such as were laboriously endeavouring to
mount. Noémi reached a spring that issued from
the side of the cliff in a dribble, was received in a
basin, and the overflow nourished a dense growth of
maidenhair-fern and moss. It was thence that the
occupants of the castle derived their drinking-water.
Hard by was the gateway. Here she was challenged,
gave her name, and was admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">L&#39;Eglise Guillem was oddly constructed. The
depth of the caves or concave shelters was not great,
not above twelve to fifteen feet, consequently would
not admit of chambers and halls in which many men
could move about. To gain space, beams had been
driven into the natural wall of rock at the back of
the caves, and brought forward to project some eight
feet over the edge of the cliff. On these projecting
rafters walls of timber filled in with stone had been
erected, and lean-to roofs added to cover them, socketed
into the cliff above the opening mouth of the
cave or series of caves. This is still a method of construction
in the country, with this exception&mdash;that
such modern dwellings are not pendulous in mid-air,
as were those of the free captains, but are now on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
solid floors, and consist of rooms, one half of which
are caves, and the other half artificial excrescences.</p>

<p class="indent">By means of this overhanging portion of the castle,
by a ladder a chamber could be reached, cut out in
the face of the cliff immediately above the mouth of
the natural cavern, a chamber at the present day visible,
but absolutely inaccessible, since the wooden excrescence
has disappeared by which it was reached.
This upper chamber was the treasury of the castle.</p>

<p class="indent">To the present day not two miles up the valley of
the Beune is a hamlet, a cluster of houses, called
Grioteaux, built in a huge cave, but with the fronts
somewhat beyond the upper lip of the cave; and in
the face of the precipice above is precisely such a
treasure-chamber, only to be reached by means of a
ladder from the roof of the house below it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&mdash;you here!&quot; exclaimed the Great Guillem
in surprise, when he saw the girl enter the one room
in which were himself and his men, about a table,
on which were scattered chalices from churches,
women&#39;s jewellery, silken dresses, even sabots plucked
off the feet of peasants. The captain was dividing
spoil.</p>

<p class="indent">The Great Guillem was much as Jean del&#39; Peyra
had described him&mdash;tall, gaunt, with a high head, and
baldness from his forehead to the crown, his hair
sandy and turning grey, dense bushy red eyebrows,
the palest of blue eyes, and a profusion of red hair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
about his jaws. The mouth was large, with thin lips,
and teeth wide apart and pointed, as though they
had been filed sharp. Men said he had a double row
in his jaw. It was the mouth of a shark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come here, little cat!&quot; shouted the freebooter.
&quot;Here are we dogs of war dividing the plunder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What plunder, father? Did you get all these
silks and trinkets from Ste. Soure?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From Ste. Soure indeed! Not that; nothing
thence but wine-casks and grain; and a fine matter
we have had hauling the barrels up into our kennel.
What do you want with us, child?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl looked at the men; there were a dozen,
and her father the thirteenth. They were in rough
and coarse clothing, each with a red cross on his left
arm&mdash;a badge of allegiance to the Cross of St. George.
Some of the companies wore a white or blue cross
when serving no political party, but the Great Guillem
was ostensibly in the English service, and as such had
been given the commandantship of Domme. The
men had been drinking, and were flushed, partly with
wine, partly with excitement, as the division of the
plunder was made by lot, the lot being a knucklebone
in a bassinet. A lawless, insolent company, and one
difficult to treat with.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi was puzzled what to do. But she was a
bold, spirited girl, and she said: &quot;This is the first
time I have been here. I claim largesse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
&quot;Largesse!&quot; laughed one of the men; &quot;I say&mdash;the
first time anyone enters he pays footing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>He</i>, yes,&quot; said the girl; &quot;but with a woman it is
other. I claim largesse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean? A share of the loot?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A large share,&quot; answered Noémi.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have two lots to one; I will surrender one to
you,&quot; said Guillem.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of all the spoil?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of all for which we are raffling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the men&mdash;the seven men you took?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are not in the game. We wait till the
ransom comes, and that will be divided not by lot but
by shares. Money is so divided, not&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Her father
tossed over some odds and ends with which the table
was cumbered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want the seven men,&quot; said Noémi.</p>

<p class="indent">A roar of laughter greeted this demand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A hundred livres! That is a fine largesse,&quot; said
one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It cannot be,&quot; said Guillem. &quot;They belong to
us all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Little one,&quot; shouted one half-drunken fellow,
&quot;we only divide among ourselves&mdash;merry companions.
We take from those who are outside the band.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I am the Captain&#39;s daughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That matters not; you are not a companion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father, give me a lot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
&quot;I will&mdash;my lot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And grant me a request.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you draw the highest lot, you shall have what
you will&mdash;save a share in the loot, and to that you can
have no right. We have our laws and are bound to
abide by them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us draw, then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The bassinet was passed round, and each drew.
There were fourteen knucklebones in it. Noémi put
in her hand first and drew, then each in succession.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hands open,&quot; shouted Guillem, and each fist was
thrust forward on the table and opened flat, exposing
the bone. The knuckles were numbered up to fourteen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fourteen!&quot; exclaimed Guillem, as he looked at
the rude die in his daughter&#39;s palm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Best of three,&quot; said a man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Again!&quot; called the Captain, after the bones had
been thrown into the bassinet and shaken.</p>

<p class="indent">The same proceeding was gone through. Again
each hand was exposed on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fourteen again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A woman and the devil have luck!&quot; shouted
one of the men. &quot;There is no beating that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye! but there is. If next time she draws one,&quot;
retorted another. &quot;She is a woman; I wish her well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! you Roger; always honour the petticoat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Again!&quot; thundered the Captain.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
Once more hands were plunged into the iron cap,
withdrawn, and placed clenched on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Reveal!&quot; cried Guillem, and immediately the
hands were turned up with the knuckle-bones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fourteen!&quot; again he shouted, as he held up the
piece his daughter had exposed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was ever luck like this!&quot; stormed one man.
&quot;And I&mdash;I never draw above five.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well; what is your request?&quot; asked Guillem.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have sworn to grant it me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; if not against rule.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then make me one of the Company!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A pause, then a shout: &quot;The Red Cross! The
Red Cross! Vive the new Companion!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In an instant a piece of crimson silk brocade, an
ecclesiastical vestment, was torn to shreds, and the
rough hands of the freebooters were fastening two
strips crosswise to Noémi&#39;s arm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="center">IN THE DEVIL&#39;S CUPS.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">&quot;A new</span> companion must justify his election,&quot;
said the sullen man, who had throughout shown ill
disposition towards Noémi.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The new companion shall do so,&quot; answered
Noémi. A deep colour flushed her olive skin. &quot;For
that I ask you to follow me, as well as that other
comrade who was as inclined to be civil as you to be
insolent. First, send down below and bid the two
servants of the Tardes go on to Ste. Soure and tarry
there till I go for them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&mdash;to Ste. Soure?&quot; said her father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not now. But I do not desire to have the Tardes&#39;
men with me. They are not of the Company.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That I will justify my election,&quot; said Noémi.
&quot;And for that I take these two mates&mdash;and no
others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not well that I go,&quot; said the sulky man.
&quot;But, if go I must, it is unwillingly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
&quot;And I go with all my heart,&quot; said he whose
name was Roger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you intend to do, child?&quot; asked her
father, puzzled and uneasy. &quot;This is a farce. Take
off the cross.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it is no farce. I will not remove the cross
till I have shown that I am worthy to be enrolled in
your band.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then what will you do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is my secret.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you demand two of the companions?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; two of the companions&mdash;he named Roger,
and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Amanieu?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Roger and Amanieu. I ask that they may accompany
me and serve me and do my bidding&mdash;on
my first <i>chevauchée</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;La Pucelle! Another Joan! To the English!
To the English! Vive la Pucelle de Domme! We
will pit her against the Pucelle de Domrémi.&quot; The
men shouted, hammered the table, and tossed the
knucklebones about. They treated the matter as a
joke.</p>

<p class="indent">Amanieu, the sulky man, was very angry at being
fixed upon to make one of a party that would
incur ridicule and expose him to the jeers of his
fellows.</p>

<p class="indent">Le Gros Guillem now interfered. &quot;If my daughter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
has said you are to attend, and I consent, you go.
Guard her well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Amanieu murmured no more. There was no insubordination
in a Company.</p>

<p class="indent">The serving-men of the Tarde brothers were dismissed,
and then Noémi prepared to depart along
with her new attendants. Her father asked no further
questions. The horses were brought from a
stable cut in the rocks. They were nimble and sure
of footing. Access to the stable was only to be had
by a drawbridge let fall over a chasm, and from the
further side of the gap a narrow track descended rapidly
to the bottom of the valley.</p>

<p class="indent">At Noémi&#39;s request the men had drawn on jackets
that concealed their red crosses, and no one seeing
the little party would have conjectured that the girl
was attended by some of the greatest ruffians and cut-throats
in the country. She knew the character of
the men, but was not afraid. The fear of her father
entertained by all the band, and the discipline maintained
in the Company, would prevent them from
doing her harm.</p>

<p class="indent">Guillem was a man of few words, but of decision
in action. The look of his pale eyes was enough, as
he sent the men with Noémi, to take from them any
spirit of insolence or rebellion had they entertained it.
They knew without more words than the three uttered
by Guillem, that if she came to harm through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
them, by their neglect, in any way, he was the man
to put them to death by slow and horrible torture.
They had seen that done once on a comrade who
had disregarded a half-expressed order. He had been
roasted over a slow fire.</p>

<p class="indent">The two men asked no questions when Noémi
took the road to Sarlat, and along the road she did
not speak with them. At Sarlat she bade them hold
back while she went on alone and on foot to make an
inquiry. Apparently satisfied at what she had learnt,
she returned to the men, remounted her horse, and
said, &quot;Forward!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She rode along the way to La Roque, a little ahead
of the two men. The day was closing in. It would
be dark by the time they reached her home.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they came to a long and tedious ascent.
The way had been at one time paved, but had not
been repaired for a century. It ran up a hog&#39;s back
or hill, through coppice that was cut every fourteen
years for the making of charcoal, direct to the point
where was the Devil&#39;s Table.</p>

<p class="indent">She halted, and turned to her followers; and they
drew rein.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen to me,&quot; she said. &quot;You do not know
whither I am leading you, for what purpose you follow
me, or what is to be gained thereby. But one
thing you do know, that you are placed under my
command by Le Gros Guillem, and that you disobey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
at your peril. I will tell you wherefore you are following
me; it is for your own advantage. You have
carried away seven men from the Del&#39; Peyras, and
you have put them to ransom at a hundred livres.
That is a large sum. It is to be divided among you
into fourteen equal shares. But let me tell you that
if this sum be not found&mdash;you will get nothing. The
seven men will be no gain to you when cast away
mutilated. Jean del&#39; Peyra has been this day to Sarlat,
he has been to the Bishop, he has been to the
Jew Levi, he has been to the Tardes at Gageac, I cannot
say where he has not been, to whom he has not
applied&mdash;but nowhere can he raise the sum. It was
too large. But that is no concern of mine. The
money must be found, or you get nothing. I can
tell you where the sum is to be found, whence it
can be taken. But understand this&mdash;no more shall
be exacted than the hundred livres. I will not have
a denier more, nor a denier less. You agree to
this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, we shall be glad of the money; we do not
want to hurt the men of Ste. Soure, and their wounds
are no pay to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well. Then we understand each other.
You would never receive any ransom but for me. It
is I who bring you where it shall be paid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And where is that?&quot; asked Amanieu.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the Devil&#39;s Table,&quot; answered Noémi.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
The men shrank back. Their superstitious fears
were aroused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not be alarmed. We shall not conjure up
the foul fiend; but we shall squeeze one of his servants.
Let us ride on and await him at the Table.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she turned towards La Roque, and in silence
they continued to ascend the hill.</p>

<p class="indent">When they had nearly reached the summit she
drew up again, and said to the men&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will explain it all. The Jew Levi comes this
way. He has been gathering in money at La Roque,
and my cousins have paid him a large sum. He has
been engaged there all day, and he made my cousins,
the Tardes, promise to send servants with him to see
him safe on his way back to Sarlat. They agreed to
send him on his way as far as the Devil&#39;s Table; and
he named the time at which he would be ready to
start. I know, if he has started on his way as he proposed,
that he will be approaching now. From the
Table onward to Sarlat he would be alone, but alone
he could not convey all the money. What he purposes
doing I cannot say. We will wait and see. He
desired that he might be attended all the way to Sarlat,
but that the Tardes would not allow. The distance
was too great, the men were needed, they would
not be home till too late. He was forced to accept
half of what he had asked. Understand, no more is
to be taken from the Jew than the ransom money.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
It were better that a Jew should lose than that seven
Christian households should be ruined.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The men laughed. They were easy in their minds
now that they understood they were to play a familiar
game&mdash;only they grudged that they were to half accomplish
it. If they caught a Jew let them squeeze
and wring him out till not a drop of the golden syrup
were left in him.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi had, however, her own ideas in the matter.
She justified her act to her conscience as a deed of
necessity. It was a marvel that her conscience felt
any scruple in the matter, as in the Middle Ages none
hesitated to defraud a Jew, none considered that a
son of Israel had any right to have meted out to him
the like justice as to a Christian. Before the Cathedral
gates at Toulouse every Good Friday a Jew had
to present himself to have his ears boxed by the Bishop,
and to acknowledge in his person on behalf of his
race its guilt in having crucified the Messiah.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here!&quot; said the girl, &quot;tie up your horses and
mine and lie in the scrub.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before them, on the left hand of the track, rose
the Devil&#39;s Table; a mound of earth had anciently
covered it, but rain had washed away the earth from
the capstone and showed the points of those blocks
which upheld it. The slab was a singularly uncouth
stone, with its flat old bed underneath, the upper surface
uneven and dinted with cup-holes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
The <i>routiers</i> had not been long in hiding before
the voice of Levi was heard, and the tramp of
his ass.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thank you, good fellows. It was gracious of
your master to lend me your escort, for, Heaven
knows! I am too poor to need one. My ass is laden
with lentils. You eat them in your fasting times,
and when not fasting, eat pig. I cannot touch the
unclean meat, and so eat lentils all the year. All my
little moneys I carried with me have been expended
in lentils for my wife Rachel and me. Ah! this must
last us a long time. We are so poor, and lentils are
so dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will give us something to drink your health,
Levi,&quot; asked one of Tardes&#39; men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! certainly. Open both your hands and I will
fill them with lentils. When Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abednego were in the palace of King Darius,
they refused the meats from the King&#39;s table
that they might eat lentils. And they grew fat! Oh!
Father Abraham, so sleek that their faces shone, and
all the young ladies ran after them. Open your
hands and I will give you lentils, and all the fair
maids of La Roque will admire you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The men laughed. &quot;Come, come, Jew, keep the
pulse for yourself, and give us something more solid&mdash;money&mdash;and
we will drink your health.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Money!&quot; exclaimed Levi; &quot;as if I had money!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
Oh, Fathers of the Covenant! poor Levi with money!&mdash;that
is a comical idea. You are jesting with me, and
I like a jest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Those lying in wait listened to the altercation that
ensued&mdash;the men murmured, then there ensued an
outcry from the Jew and a burst of laughter from the
men&mdash;they had raised and thrown down on the ground
the sack which the ass was carrying.</p>

<p class="indent">The Jew shouted and entreated and swore, but to
no avail. The two serving-men ran off on their way
back to La Roque Gageac, full of glee, rejoicing that
they had served the man such a trick, for they well
knew that he would hardly be able to replace the sack
on his ass.</p>

<p class="indent">After Levi had convinced himself that his appeals
were in vain, he returned to the fallen sack, and
vainly endeavoured to lift it upon the ass. He could
raise it at one end, but not bear the entire weight.
He became very angry, and grumbled and cursed, and
prayed to Heaven for assistance.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, as his sole chance, he endeavoured to roll
the sack up the sepulchral mound, and so to tilt it on
to the Devil&#39;s Table. By that means, if he drew up
his ass by the mouth of the burial-chamber, where
treasure-seekers had grubbed and made a hollow, he
hoped to be able to replace the burden on the back
that was to bear it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Mother Sarah!&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
lamented the Jew, &quot;come to me in my necessity and
help me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hands were laid on his shoulder. With a scream
of fear he sprang back, and saw two male and a female
figure before him. Dusk had set in, and he could not
distinguish who they were.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jew!&quot; said Noémi, &quot;we want a hundred livres.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A hundred lentils! Let me go! Help me with
my sack, and they are yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jew!&quot; said the girl; &quot;do not delay us and yourself.
We will escort you within sight of the lights
of the town&mdash;when you have paid us the hundred
livres.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hear her, Father Abraham!&quot; cried the unhappy
man. &quot;She thinks that I have money, who have only
a few lentils on which to feed my wife and me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know what you have,&quot; said Noémi. &quot;You
have all the money paid you by the Tardes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a lie&mdash;I have been paid no money; I have
been given a sack of lentils instead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Levi&mdash;I was present when it was paid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&mdash;you are a Tarde! and the Tardes are
thieves!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not a Tarde.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a Tarde&mdash;and these are Tardes&#39; servants,
and you will cheat and rob me. I shall appeal to the
Bishop!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
&quot;Strike a light,&quot; said the girl. &quot;Let the man see
who we are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a flint and steel Amanieu produced sparks,
and presently held a wisp of dry grass blazing over his
head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here,&quot; said Noémi. &quot;Do you know this?&quot;
She showed the red cross on her arm. &quot;Look at the
shoulders of my mates. Do you know who they are?
Do you know me? I am Le Gros Guillem&#39;s daughter.
Open your sack.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, pity me! Pity me!&quot; sobbed the terrified
Jew.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One hundred livres&mdash;not a denier under, not a
denier over,&quot; answered the girl. &quot;See, in the Devil&#39;s
Table are ten saucers; put ten livres into each, and
you, Amanieu, and you, Roger, count. Jew, when the
last coin is paid, you shall go on with the rest. You
do not stir till the sum is paid that I require.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Jew faltered, trembled, stuttered some unintelligible
words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Levi!&quot; said Noémi, &quot;you know how Guillem&#39;s
men deal with the refractory. Ho! a string here for
his thumbs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The ten cups were filled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="center">A SINGED GLOVE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A commotion</span>, suppressed in outward manifestation,
agitated Ste. Soure. Very little work was being
done in the fields and vineyards. What work was
done had little reference to agriculture.</p>

<p class="indent">Men hurried about, but were cautious not to allow
it to be seen by anyone at a distance what their occupation
was.</p>

<p class="indent">In a place like Ste. Soure, in a valley between
precipices, nothing was easier than for a spy to observe
all that was going on in a village. If on this
occasion one commissioned by the Captain of the
Free Company that occupied l&#39;Eglise Guillem had
stationed himself at a suitable point, he would have
seen that Ste. Soure was alive, but would not have
been able to distinguish what engaged the inhabitants.</p>

<p class="indent">He would, indeed, have noticed the peasants
bringing together their faggots of vine-prunings, have
heard the bleating of sheep that were being killed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
and later, had the wind blown his way, have noticed
that the air was impregnated with the odour of
melted tallow.</p>

<p class="indent">That the people of Ste. Soure should be in a condition
of more liveliness than usual would not have
surprised him, after the event of the rush made on
the place by the Free Companions, and the capture of
some of the householders.</p>

<p class="indent">But no spy was sent to observe the doings of the
villagers. The usual watch was kept from the eyrie of
the Church of Guillem, but from it the village of Ste.
Soure and the Castle of Le Peuch were not visible.</p>

<p class="indent">The sudden raid had so quelled the inhabitants
that no danger was anticipated from that quarter.
What was Ogier del&#39; Peyra but a little Seigneur? So
little that it was not worth while for any of the big
men in the neighbourhood to sustain his cause. In
those rough times the small men were pinched out.
Only the great ones held their own. There was no
security for any man who stood in independence, unless
he were very great indeed. In an earlier age the
soil had belonged to many hundreds and thousands of
free landholders, who owed no man anything except a
slight tax in money or kind to the Duke of Aquitaine
or to the Count of Périgord. But that condition of
affairs was past. The little freemen had been broken
in pieces by the violence of the marauders, of the
barons, by their own mutual quarrels, and nearly all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
had surrendered their independence into the hands of
great Seigneurs in their neighbourhood; they had
given up their freedom in return for assurance of protection.</p>

<p class="indent">Ogier del&#39; Peyra, however, represented one of the
few families which had not thus passed into vassalage.
For that very reason he was viewed askance by the
barons of the neighbourhood, to whichever faction
they belonged; and as none of them were bound to
sustain his cause, not one of them, as Ogier well knew,
would draw sword in his behalf against so redoubtable
an adversary as Le Gros Guillem, and would be still
less inclined to advance him money.</p>

<p class="indent">Not only did Ogier know this, but the Free Captain
knew it also; and, knowing it, thought it not
worth the pains to observe the movements of the man
he had plundered, and whom he despised.</p>

<p class="indent">One thing did Guillem regret&mdash;that he had not
taken Le Peuch, the refuge and stronghold of the
Del&#39; Peyras; but just as Ogier knew his weakness and
insulation, so had he accumulated precautions against
attack. His fortress, or castle, was situated in a similar
position to that of Guillem, at the head of a steep
rubble slope, but it was stronger immeasurably than
that of the &quot;Church,&quot; for the cliff above it was vastly
more lofty, and it was literally honeycombed with
chambers. It was precisely due to the fact that the
habitation of the family was in the rock, and of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
rock, as already intimated, that they had received
their name of Del&#39; Peyra. Had not the villagers been
completely taken by surprise when the Companions
fell on Ste. Soure, they would have carried off their
valuables, and taken refuge themselves in inaccessible
places, and left only their empty houses to be ransacked
by the freebooters.</p>

<p class="indent">Long exemption from molestation had made them
careless.</p>

<p class="indent">It was customary with the robber bands not to
devastate the hamlets and villages and farms in their
immediate neighbourhood. They needed the daily
supplies of food that the peasants could furnish, and
they bought these, and maintained a good understanding
with the peasantry. When they foraged it was at
a distance. It was precisely because &quot;l&#39;Eglise&quot; was
so near to Ste. Soure that the villagers had not anticipated
an onslaught.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, although the peasants on the opposite side
of the river, who were under the shadow of the crags
occupied by the <i>routiers</i> knew themselves to be safe,
and found a market for their produce, yet they had
no love for their tyrannisers. They were sufficiently
shrewd to be aware that they were exposed to be plundered,
their houses wasted, their wives and daughters
carried off by other freebooters, or even by ordinary
Companions-in-Arms, such as claimed to serve the
French. The Counts of Périgord&mdash;who should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
been their protectors&mdash;were leaders in violence, at the
head of several lawless bands, and usually marched
under the leopards, so that the ban of the French
king had been launched against one Count after
another, and he only returned to allegiance for a
moment, to break faith at the first occasion. The
Castle of Montignac, the headquarters of these
countly scoundrels, lay high up the same valley of
the Vézère; and the ruffians of the Count passed
up and down it, traversing the fields and villages continually.
It was to them a matter of supreme indifference
which crown was supposed to exercise authority
and afford protection where they went, for neither
possessed any real authority, neither afforded the
smallest protection.</p>

<p class="indent">Ogier del&#39; Peyra sat in the porch of the church
issuing orders, and his son was by him.</p>

<p class="indent">All at once a child on the roof of the church cried
out&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see&mdash;I see&mdash;seven men coming, and a lady riding;
and I think one is our Petiton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! our men!&quot; exclaimed Ogier; and Jean
ran to the roof of the church to look.</p>

<p class="indent">He was down directly after. &quot;Father, there is no
doubt of it. Gros Guillem&#39;s daughter is bringing
them here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As a gift? Does he restore them free of ransom?&quot;
exclaimed Ogier. &quot;If so we cannot proceed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
&quot;I will run and meet them,&quot; said Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">The tidings spread like wildfire that the men who
had been carried off were on their way home. Jean
hastened to the river side and was ferried over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have brought them!&quot; said Noémi when she
saw him. Her eye was flashing with pleasure. &quot;See&mdash;they
are all here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did your father surrender them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed. &quot;I bought them. I paid the ransom.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You! Where did you get the money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See.&quot; She exposed her arm with the red cross.
&quot;I won my spurs. I robbed the Jew. Now you do
not think so ill of me, say that.&quot; She leaned from
her horse to look into his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">He averted his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thank you for the men. I hate the deed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The man was but a Jew!&quot; pleaded Noémi.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And a robbery is but a robbery,&quot; answered Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl bit her lips and frowned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is what I get by that I have done, and I
have ridden all night to gratify you. I asked my
father. I entreated that the men might be let go
free. He would not hearken. Then I did this. I
could not get the men discharged in any other way.
Let them go back,&quot; said the girl sullenly; &quot;back
into bonds and be served as was threatened. You
are content so long as the Jew has his moneys.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
&quot;Not so. The men are free&mdash;they cannot go
back. I had rather they had been freed by any other
means.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And by any other person&mdash;say it all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will not say that. There, Noémi,&quot; said the
young man, laying his hand on the horse&#39;s neck, &quot;I
know you meant kindly and right by us. It is not
your fault; it is the fault of your blood; it is the
fault of the times that you have gone about it in a
wrong way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was no other way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not say that. I was going to Bergerac to
raise the money there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And pawn your inheritance to a Christian usurer
who is worse than a Jew. You have your men, you
have your land&mdash;be content. If wrong is done, I did
it.&quot; Noémi abandoned her horse and entered the
ferry-boat with the men and Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">The joy, the tears, the passionate affection with
which the recovered men were welcomed, clung to by
their wives and children and friends, moved the girl,
and her cheek grew pale and her eyes filled. Jean
observed the emotion and said nothing to her, but to
himself he breathed: &quot;She is not heartless! The
good is not all dead in her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the women, supposing rightly that the
men owed their release to Noémi, but not knowing
who she was, came to her, took her hand, kissed it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
knelt and put to their lips the hem of her skirt. She
was abashed, and shrank back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shall see,&quot; said Jean. &quot;I will show you
from what you have saved these poor fellows!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He led her into the cottage of the Rossignols, and
she remained silent, apparently cold, looking at the
crippled man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you sit up?&quot; she asked, after a long pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit up&mdash;yes,&quot; he said, and moved his elbow and
heaved himself up; &quot;but it opens the wounds again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And&mdash;can you put your feet down?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Feet; I&#39;ll never do that more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor stand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God help me! Never stand before man, never
kneel before God. I&#39;m a young man; I&#39;m five-and-twenty,
and have got three children. I&#39;ll never do
aught but lie as a log all the years I have to live!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is a trifle for you,&quot; said Noémi, putting
money into his hand. &quot;I would I had more. Hush!
I cannot bear that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The poor woman, still half distraught, now worked
to further excitement by the return of the seven men
safe and sound, while her own husband lay in irrecoverable
wretchedness, broke into a storm of curses
against Le Gros Guillem, and of blasphemy against
God. It was more horrible to hear her than to see
the man, who bore his lot not so much with patience
as with stolidity.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
Then in came Ogier del&#39; Peyra.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So,&quot; said he, &quot;you have released my men! Did
Le Gros Guillem let them pass out of his hands for
nothing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I paid him the hundred livres,&quot; said Noémi,
speaking with difficulty. Something was in her
throat choking her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then,&quot; said Ogier, &quot;we owe him no debt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are returning there&mdash;I mean to him&mdash;to
the Church?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I go to see him again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What debt of gratitude we owe is to you&mdash;not to
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, let me say this: Do not stay at the
Church.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not going to stay there. I shall but say
farewell to&mdash;&mdash;&quot; the girl hesitated, looked at the crippled
Rossignol, at his crazy wife, and concluded her
sentence in an undertone&mdash;&quot;to him, and then away to
Domme.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is well. Mark my words. Do not stay there&mdash;not
a night&mdash;not a night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why so? Do you ask that? Is not the wrath
of God hanging as a thundercloud over that rock? Is
it not full charged with lightnings? When it bursts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
will it spare the innocent? Will it not involve all in
one sudden destruction? Mark my words: do not
tarry there&mdash;no, not an hour. Your men who came
with you are here. They are at Le Peuch, and ready
to attend you on your return. Do not tarry. Take
counsel. L&#39;Eglise de Guillem is no place for innocent
maidens. It is no church where are holy thoughts
and devout prayers&mdash;it is the Church of the Foul
Fiend, and the mouth of the bottomless pit yawns
there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thank you,&quot; said Noémi. &quot;I know what it is.
I am not going to tarry there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is one favour I ask of you,&quot; said the old
man. &quot;It is to take a message from me to&mdash;to the
Big Guillem.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will take it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell him that when one gentleman is about to
do the other the favour of a visit he sends a notice
that he is coming. That is true courtesy. He forgot
to do that to me. I was not ready to receive him
with hospitality. Now, render me the grace to hand
him this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ogier extended to the girl a leather glove singed
by fire and the ends of the fingers burnt off.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi hesitated to take it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not fear,&quot; said the old man; &quot;it will not hurt
you. It is but a token. Your fa&mdash;I mean Le Gros
Guillem, will accept the courtesy. Take it, and go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
An hour later Noémi was in the Church of Guillem
and before her father.</p>

<p class="indent">Somewhat hesitatingly she held out to him the
singed glove.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Sieur del&#39; Peyra sends you this,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Le Gros Guillem took the glove, threw it on the
table, and burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The mouse defies the lion! Good! This is good!
I thank you, Noémi, for bringing me this; it is a
right merry jest. I drink to his visit! May he come
speedily.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="center">BY FIRE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">A strange</span> stillness came over the Vézère valley
that evening at sundown. Hardly a man was about,
not a sound was heard save the barking of a dog in a
farm on one side of the river, and the answer of another
dog in one on the further side. There was,
however, a mysterious hiss in the air about every
dwelling and cluster of habitations. Now and then a
woman was seen, but it was to call in her children
who had run out, and, forgetful of all that had passed,
had begun to play.</p>

<p class="indent">The sun went down in the west, painting the rocks
on the left bank of the Vézère a daffodil yellow, and
then slowly a cold, death-like grey stole over the landscape.
With the sun the life had gone; and yet,
strange to say, no sooner had this dead glaze come
over the face of Nature than the human beings woke
to activity and began to issue from their houses, cautiously
at first, then with greater boldness as the shadows
thickened. The men bore their reaping-hooks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
their pruning-knives strapped to the end of poles,
converting them into formidable weapons. Others
had their bills thrust through their leather belts; and
every bill and knife was fresh sharpened, explaining
the significance of the strange hiss which had been
in the air. It had been caused by the grindstones and
the files in every house.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the men who had been standing in knots
were marshalled into two distinct parties or bands.
One, armed with their extemporised halberds and
lances, remained in Ste. Soure under Ogier, whereas
the other division, laden with sacks, with casks, with
loads of faggots, passed over the river, were joined by
a contingent from the left bank of the Vézère, and
proceeded to ascend the hills. Behind this party,
borne by four men, was Rossignol, lying on his bed.
His wife desired to follow, and was with difficulty restrained
and sent back to take care of her children.
Silently, patiently, the men ascended the steep flanks
of the hillside, each bearing his burden; even the
wounded Rossignol endured the inevitable jerking
without a murmur.</p>

<p class="indent">A word must here be given to explain the salient
character of the country. Originally a vast region in
Périgord&mdash;the Black Périgord, as it was called from
its sombre woods and deep cleft ravines, was one plateau
of hard chalk, raised from six hundred and fifty
to nine hundred feet above the sea. At some geologic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
period difficult to define an immense rush of water
passed over the plain and tore every rent formed by
the upheaval of the chalk into gorge and gully, down
which the furious waters poured, scooping out the
sides and tearing themselves away. The course taken
by the flood is easily recognisable by this fact&mdash;that it
has left its wash on the tops of the plateau, where to
the present day lies a film of caoline, that is to say of
feldspathic clay, the produce of the granite ranges to
the north and north-east; and this caoline lies in
some places in considerable pockets, white as chalk,
and only distinguishable from chalk by the experienced
eye, and lies in sufficiently important beds to
be worked and exported to porcelain factories. Nay,
more than this: on the top of these great plateaux of
chalk are strewn boulders and pebbles of volcanic production,
that were derived unmistakably from the far
away Auvergne mountains.</p>

<p class="indent">The flood that swirled over the chalk plains not
only tore them into islets, and ate out paths through
every chink, but also left the surfaces undulating, having
washed away what beds were soft and left those
which were hard.</p>

<p class="indent">These plateaux are more or less untenanted by
human beings, because more or less soilless. They are
given over to forest or to baldness.</p>

<p class="indent">The ravines, the river-valleys, are walled in by
precipices with gulfs here and there in their sides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
where the rock has crumbled away, or caverns have
collapsed, and which allow, as lateral combes, access
to the riverside. Up such a combe did the peasants
now toil, zigzagging, corkscrewing their way, far to the
rear of the headland of l&#39;Eglise Guillem, and wholly
invisible from it.</p>

<p class="indent">The Captain had so far paid attention to the
challenge conveyed by the scorched glove as to give
the sentinel on the gate-tower warning to be on the
alert, but he had neglected to post anyone on the top
of the cliff that overhung his eagle nest. He anticipated
no danger from that quarter, for his castle was
inaccessible thence, unless, what was inconceivable,
assailants should descend on him like spiders from
above, at the end of ropes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bah!&quot; scoffed the Chieftain; &quot;a boor! What
is Del&#39; Peyra but a country clown? I will teach him
such a lesson in a day or two as will make him skip.
There is not a Seigneur in the land will lend him
half-a-dozen horsemen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was, however, an incident in the past that
had entirely escaped the memory of Guillem, even if
he had heard of it.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the twelfth century, a carpenter,
Durand by name, had roused the peasants to free
themselves of their oppressors. What the king could
not, what the nobles would not do, that they had
done. They had assembled in great multitudes, assumed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
a white linen hood, called themselves &quot;The
Brotherhood of Peace,&quot; and hoped to initiate an era
of tranquillity by massacring without mercy every
<i>routier</i> in the land. They had butchered many thousands,
had defeated them in pitched battles, but had
themselves been quelled by a combination of the
nobles when they attempted to interfere with their
turbulence.</p>

<p class="indent">That was a matter of two centuries ago, and was
not likely to be repeated. Two hundred years of the
scourge had whipped every vestige of independence
out of the peasants. The Free Companion of the
fourteenth and fifteenth century no more feared a
combination against him among the peasants than
the latter anticipated a revolt in his henroost whence
he gathered his eggs. But something had occurred
in the north of the land&mdash;in France proper&mdash;the
rumour of which had travelled throughout the country,
and which, dimly, feebly, had brought out the
idea of national feeling in the south&mdash;that was the
great success of the French under the Maid of Orleans.
Heaven had interfered; the Saints had interested
themselves for the afflicted people, for the humbled
Crown. The Spirit of God, as in the days of
old, had raised up a deliverer&mdash;and that deliverer a
woman.</p>

<p class="indent">The advent of the Maid of Domrémi was of the
past, but not forgotten. There was something in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
the story of Joan to rouse the imagination of a lively
and excitable people, and to make them believe that
the time was come when Heaven would interfere to
assist their feeble arms.</p>

<p class="indent">The outrage committed at Ste. Soure on Rossignol,
the threat hanging over seven others, had
served to rouse the peasantry of the neighbourhood,
and as one man they placed themselves under the
direction of Ogier, a Seigneur indeed, but in so small
a way, as to be but a step removed from the peasant;
a man whom they could almost consider as one of
themselves, and yet sufficiently raised above them to
be able to command obedience, and not incur their
jealousy.</p>

<p class="indent">As the train of laden men toiled up the ascent,
they were joined by charcoal-burners from the coppice
with their forks, who fell in, relieved some of
the most heavily burdened and said no word. One
resolution, one hate, animated the whole mass, combined
to make one effort to shake off the detested
incubus. It was marvellous how rapidly and how
quietly the conjuration had been formed.</p>

<p class="indent">When the body of men had reached the top of
the hill and were on the plain, they found men there
awaiting them from villages beyond, animated by the
same spirit, ready to move in the same direction, and
to carry out the warfare in the same way, for they
also were laden like those from Ste. Soure.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
The whole troop now advanced through the brushwood
to the bare space above the precipice where trees
were scanty.</p>

<p class="indent">The night had become very obscure. It was hard
to distinguish where the foot could be placed in safety.
The very dearth of trees, moreover, warned the men
to advance with extreme caution.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean del&#39; Peyra had drawn a white sleeve over his
right arm, and this was visible in the murkiness of
ever-deepening darkness. With this white arm he
gave the signals. Orders were communicated in
whispers. Behind, under the coppice, at no great
distance, was a charcoal-burner&#39;s heap. The men
who attended to the steaming pile stood by it with
their spades and prongs.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean raised his white arm. At once those behind
him in a chain did the same. At the signal a charcoal-burner
drove his fork into the fuming mass,
made an opening, and a flame shot up. Next moment
a sod was cast on the gap and the flame extinguished.</p>

<p class="indent">One, two, three, four&mdash;to twenty-five, counted
Jean. Again he lifted his white arm. Again the
signal was telegraphed back to the charcoal-burners,
and again was an opening made and a tongue of fire
shot up, to be again instantly extinguished.</p>

<p class="indent">One, two, three, four&mdash;to twenty-five. A third
time Jean raised his arm, and a third time the gleam
of flame mounted and was blotted out.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
A pause of expectation.</p>

<p class="indent">Then from the valley&mdash;from the further side of
the Vézère&mdash;a flash.</p>

<p class="indent">One, two, three, four&mdash;to twenty-five.</p>

<p class="indent">A second flare.</p>

<p class="indent">One, two, three, four&mdash;to twenty-five.</p>

<p class="indent">A third gleam.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father is ready,&quot; whispered Jean. &quot;Now we
must find the exact spot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It is one thing to know where is a cave or, indeed,
any object marking the face of a cliff when seen from
below and quite another to discover that same cave,
to find out when and where you are immediately
above it as you walk on the summit of the precipice.
Every feature that marks a site as seen from below
fails when you stand above.</p>

<p class="indent">If this be the case in broad daylight what must
it be by night?</p>

<p class="indent">There was but one way in which Jean del&#39; Peyra
could discover the exact position of the Church of
Guillem, and that was by being held by the feet and
extending himself, lying prostrate, over the edge of
the cliff. Leaning over the abyss he looked below
and to the right and left in the darkness, then signed
to be withdrawn.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Too much to the left!&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">He walked cautiously along the edge till he came
to what he believed to be the right spot. Again he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
was extended over the brink, and was again out in his
reckoning.</p>

<p class="indent">A third attempt was more successful. With a
rapid wave of his hand he signed, and was drawn back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have looked down their chimney,&quot; he said,
&quot;and heard their laughter come up with the reek,
and seen the glow of their hearth. Here! build it
here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At once a hundred hands were engaged in piling
up faggots, heaping casks on them and emptying the
sacks over the wood. These sacks had been filled
with mutton fat. Stones also were planted on the
extreme edge. The process was slow. Caution had
to be used lest any of the combustible matter should
fall over before set alight, and, dropping on the projecting
roof or galleries, give the alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">The wall of stones erected outside the faggots
served a double purpose. In the first place it contained
the masses of pine-wood and other combustibles,
and preserved them from lapse, but the main
object aimed at was, when overthrown, to break in the
tiles of the roof so as to allow the molten pitch from
the barrels and the flaming tallow to run in among
the woodwork and set it on fire. But for this, there
would be no assurance of success.</p>

<p class="indent">Considerable time was allowed to pass. It was
thought advisable not to precipitate action, but to
allow the freebooters to retire to rest.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
The men seated themselves in perfect stillness on
the grass and on stones. On the inner face of the
enormous pile of combustibles lay Rossignol on his bed.</p>

<p class="indent">The night was without wind. Not a leaf stirred&mdash;there
was not even a whisper among the short grass&mdash;only
the continuous twitter of the crickets and, now
and then from far below, yet audible at that height,
the croak of a bullfrog in a backwater of the Vézère.</p>

<p class="indent">The sky had been overspread with clouds, which
had rendered the night one of pitch blackness; but
these dissolved. Whither they went was inexplicable&mdash;they
were not rolled away by the wind, but appeared
to evaporate, and let the stars shine through. Then, in
the starlight, the valley below became visible, and the
river gleamed up, reflecting the feeble light in the sky.</p>

<p class="indent">A low-lying fog formed in the valley of the Beune,
and lay upon the spongy level, like a fall of sleet.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean made a sign; he was again thrust forward
over the edge of the cliff, and remained for some minutes
looking down and listening.</p>

<p class="indent">Then slowly, with upraised hand, he made the
requisite signal. He was hastily drawn back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All is still,&quot; he said. &quot;The fire is nearly out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then the other fire shall be kindled!&quot; said one
of the men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nicole!&quot; said Jean. &quot;A brand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man addressed went to the charcoal-burner&#39;s
heap. A thrill ran through the throng. All rose to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
their feet; even the mutilated man on the mattress
lifted himself to a sitting posture.</p>

<p class="indent">Silently the men moved between the faggots and
the wall of loose stones they had raised, each armed
with a stout pole.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean put a cow-horn to his mouth and blew a blast
that rang into the night as the blast of Judgment.
Instantly the rocks and stones were levered over the
edge, and instantly the brand, spluttering and blazing,
was put into the hand of Rossignol.</p>

<p class="indent">It was fitting that he should light the pyre&mdash;he
who had most suffered. That was why he had been
borne to the head of the cliff.</p>

<p class="indent">Rossignol drove the flaming torch into the mass of
vine-faggots, and instantly up leaped the flame. It
ran aloft in the mass, licked and lighted the tallow, it
caressed, then exploded the casks of tar, and the whole
pyre roared as a beast ravening for its prey.</p>

<p class="indent">And its prey was given it.</p>

<p class="indent">With their forks, with staves, the whole flaming,
raging mass was cast over the edge after the avalanche
of stones had been discharged.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>

The rock castles on the Vézère and the Dordogne all bear
traces of having been burnt. History is silent, but tradition
among the peasantry is very precise. They state that it was
they who, at the close of the Hundred Years&#39; War, ridded themselves
of the Free Companies, and that they did it by the means
described in this chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="center">THE TEN CROSSES.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Ogier del&#39; Peyra</span>, with a much larger body of
men, murderously, if not well, equipped, had left Ste.
Soure an hour after the departure of Jean. The
Vézère makes a great sweep to meet the Beune, but,
as though disgusted at the insignificance of its
tributary, after having received its waters, it at once
turns and flows in an almost directly opposite direction,
leaving a broad, flat tongue of land round which
it curls, a tongue of rich alluvial soil, interspersed
with gravel that is purple in autumn with crocus,
and in summer blue with salvia.</p>

<p class="indent">Here the party, headed by Ogier, waited in patience
till the signal flashed thrice from the heights
opposite, when it was immediately answered by three
corresponding flares of dry grass.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Ogier and his men, under cover of the darkness,
moved up the river to the ford, waded across
the water, and cautiously crept along the river bank
among the osiers in straggling line, till they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
reached a suitable point below the &quot;Church.&quot; From
this point they could see the lights from the windows
of that unhallowed edifice shining before them, half-way
up the sky like stars, but stars of lurid hue.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they sat down in the dewy grass and waited.
Hour passed after hour. The stars before them waxed
faint and went out.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, suddenly, bringing all to their feet, came
the peal of the horn, echoed and re-echoed from every
cliff, and followed by a crash and a flare.</p>

<p class="indent">The scene that ensued was one such as none who
witnessed it had ever had a chance of beholding before,
or were likely to see again.</p>

<p class="indent">The immense pile of brushwood and fat and other
fuel caught with rapidity and rose in a burst of flame
high up, as it were in mid-heaven, followed immediately
by its being poured over the lip of the precipice,
the molten, blazing tar, the incandescent fat,
streaked the cliff as with rivers of light, fell on the
projecting roof, ran in through the interstices created
by the fall of stones that had shivered the covering
tiles, and set fire to the rafters they had protected.</p>

<p class="indent">Dense volumes of swirling red smoke, in which
danced ghostly jets of blue flame, rolled about the
habitation of the robber band, and penetrated to its
interior. It broke out of the windows in long spirals
and tongues, forked as those of adders.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
The rocks up the Vézère were visible, glaring
orange, every tree was lit up, and its trunk turned to
gold. The Vézère glowed a river of flame; clouds
that had vanished gathered, crowding to see the spectacle,
and palpitated above it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forward!&quot; yelled Ogier, and the whole party
rushed up the steep ascent.</p>

<p class="indent">For one reason it would have been better had
they crept up the steep slope before the horn was
blown, so as to be ready at once to burst the gates
and occupy every avenue. But Ogier had considered
this course, and had deemed the risk greater than the
advantage. To climb the rubble slope without displacing
the shale was impossible; to do so without
making sufficient noise to alarm the sentinel was
hardly feasible in such a still night. This might
have been done in blustering wind and lashing rain,
not on such a night as that when the bullfrog&#39;s call
rang down the valley and was answered by another
frog a mile distant.</p>

<p class="indent">The ascent was arduous; it could not have been
made easily in pitch darkness; now it was effected
rapidly by the glare of the cataract of falling fire and
of blazing rafters.</p>

<p class="indent">In ten minutes, with faces streaming, with lungs
blowing, the peasants reached the gate-house. They
beat at it with stones, with their fists; they drove
their pikes at it, but could not open it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
Then a man&mdash;it was one of those who had been
taken and confined in the castle&mdash;bid all stand back.
He buckled on to his feet a sort of spiked shoe, with
three prongs in each sole, and held a crooked axe in
his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not been in there for nothing,&quot; laughed
he. &quot;I saw what they had for climbing walls, and
I&#39;ve made the like at my forge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he went to the wall, drove in the end of his
pick, and in a moment, like a cat, went up from stone
course to stone course, till he reached the summit of
the wall, when he threw aside his foot-grapnels and
leaped within. In the panic caused by the sudden
avalanche of stones and fire the sentinel had deserted
the gate. The oak doors were cast open, and the
whole body of armed men burst in.</p>

<p class="indent">They found the small garrison huddled together,
paralysed with fear, all their daring, their insolence,
their readiness on an occasion gone. They stood like
sheep, unable to defend themselves, and were taken
without offering any resistance.</p>

<p class="indent">The surprise was so complete, the awfulness of the
manner in which they were visited was so overwhelming,
that the ruffians did not know whether they
were not called to their final account, and whether
their assailants were not fiends from the flaming abyss.</p>

<p class="indent">It had come on them in the midst of sleep when
stupefied with drink.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
&quot;Follow me!&quot; ordered Ogier, and he led the way
through fallen flakes of fire, smouldering beams, and
smoking embers, to a portion of the castle that was
intact. It consisted wholly of a cavern faced up with
stone, and the cataract of fire had not reached it, or
had not injured it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bring the prisoners to me,&quot; said Ogier. &quot;Where
is the Captain? Where is Le Gros Guillem?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The head of the band was not taken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Disperse&mdash;seek him everywhere!&quot; ordered Del&#39;
Peyra.</p>

<p class="indent">The men ran in every possible direction. They
searched every cranny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He has escaped up the ladder to the Last
Refuge!&quot; shouted one. The Last Refuge was the
chamber excavated above the projecting roof of the
castle, cut in the solid rock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He cannot,&quot; said another, &quot;the ladder was the
first thing to burn. See, it is in pieces now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he be there,&quot; scoffed a third, &quot;let him there
abide. He can neither get up nor down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not think he is there. He is in Hell&#39;s
Mouth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This Hell&#39;s Mouth was the tortuous cavern opening
upon the ledge of rock occupied by the castle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he is there, who will follow him?&quot; asked one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye! who&mdash;when the foul fiend will hide him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not believe it,&quot; said one of the men who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
been confined in the &quot;Church.&quot; He indicated with
his finger. &quot;There is a <i>mal-pas</i> yonder; he has
escaped along that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A <i>mal-pas</i>, in fact, exists in many of these rock
castles. It consists of a track sometimes natural,
often artificially cut in the face of the cliff, so narrow
that only a man with an unusually steady head can
tread it; often is the <i>mal-pas</i> so formed that it cannot
be walked along upright, but in a bent posture.
Often also it is cut through abruptly and purposely
to be crossed by a board which he who has fled
over it can kick down and so intercept pursuit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bring up the men for me to judge them,&quot; said
Ogier, &quot;and you, Mathieu, give me your sharp-pointed
pick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The man addressed handed the implement to his
Seigneur, who seated himself on the floor of rock
with his legs apart and extended.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Giraud!&quot; said Ogier, &quot;and you, Roland, run out
a beam through one of the windows&mdash;through yonder,
and one of you find rope&mdash;abundance. How many
are here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are twelve,&quot; was the answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is well; twelve&mdash;enough rope to hang
twelve men, one after another from the window.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sufficiency of rope was not to be found.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It matters not,&quot; said Ogier. &quot;There are other
ways into another world than along a rope. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
shall walk the beam. Thrust it through the window
and rope the end of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which end?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This one in the room, to hold it down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A large beam, fallen from the roof in the adjoining
chamber, and still smoking and glowing at one
end, was dragged in, and the burning end thrust out
through a window. The driving it through the opening,
together with the inrush of air to the heated
apartments, caused the red and charred wood to burst
into light; it projected some ten feet beyond the
wall, fizzing, spurting forth jets of blue flame over the
abyss.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Number one!&quot; shouted Ogier. &quot;Make him
walk the rafter. Drive him forward with your pikes
if he shrinks back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">One of the ruffians of the band, his face as parchment,
speechless in the stupefaction of his fear, was
made to mount the beam, and then the peasants round
shouted, drove at him with their knives and pruning-hooks,
and made him pass through the window.</p>

<p class="indent">There were three men seated on the end of the
beam, which rested on a bench in the chamber.</p>

<p class="indent">The moment the unhappy wretch had disappeared
through the window, Ogier began to hew with his
pick into the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forward! He is hanging back! He clings to
the wall! Coward! He is endeavouring to scramble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
in again!&quot; was yelled by the peasants, crowding
round the window to watch the man on the charred
and glowing beam end.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drive him off with a pike! Make him dance on
the embers!&quot; called one within, and a reaping-hook,
bound to a pole, was thrust forth.</p>

<p class="indent">A scream, horrible in its agony, in its intensity;
and those seated on the beam felt there was no longer
a counterpoise.</p>

<p class="indent">Chip, chip, went Ogier.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently he looked up. He had cut a Greek
cross in the chalk floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Number two!&quot; he ordered.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the wretch who was seized burst from his
captors, rushed up to Ogier, threw himself on his
knees, and implored to be spared. He would do anything.
He would forswear the English. He would
never plunder again.</p>

<p class="indent">Old Del&#39; Peyra looked at him coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you ever spare one who fell into your
hands? Did you spare Rossignol? Make him walk
the beam.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The shrieking wretch was lifted by strong arms on
to the rafter; he refused to stand, he threw himself
on his knees, he struggled, bit, prayed, sobbed&mdash;all
the manhood was gone out of him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thrust him through the window,&quot; said one.
&quot;If he will not walk the beam he shall cling to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
The brigand&#39;s efforts were in vain. He was driven
through the opening. In his frantic efforts to save
himself he gripped the rafter, hanging from it, his
legs swinging in space.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cut off his fingers,&quot; said one.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the man, to escape a blow from an axe, ran
his hands along, put them on glowing red charcoal,
and dropped.</p>

<p class="indent">Chip, chip! went Ogier. He had cut a second
cross.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Number three!&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">The man whose turn came thrust aside those who
held him, leaped on the beam, and walked deliberately
through the window and bounded into the darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">Chip, chip! went Ogier. He worked on till he
had incised a third cross in the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus one by one was sent to his death out of the
chamber reeking with wood-smoke, illumined by the
puffs of flame from the still burning buildings that
adjoined. Ten crosses had been cut in the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Number eleven!&quot; said Ogier; and at that same
moment his son Jean entered at the head of those who
had ignited and sent down the cataract of fire that
had consumed the nest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you doing, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sending them before their Judge,&quot; answered
Ogier. &quot;See these ten crosses. There are ten have
been dismissed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
Then the man who had been brought forward to
be sent along the same road as the rest said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not cry for life; but this I say; it was I,
aye, I and my fellow here, Amanieu, who provided the
hundred livres, without which the seven would not
have been set free.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You provided it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye, under the Captain&#39;s daughter. It was we
who did it. If that goes to abate our sentence&mdash;well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father, spare these two,&quot; pleaded Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As you will, Jean; but there is space for two
more crosses. Would&mdash;would I could cut an eleventh,
and that a big one, for the Gros Guillem.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then murmurs arose. The peasants, their love of
revenge, their lust for slaughter whetted, clamoured
for the death of the last two of the band.</p>

<p class="indent">But Jean was firm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My father surrenders them to me,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then let them run on the <i>mal-pas</i>,&quot; shouted one
of the peasants.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good!&quot; said the brigand Roger; &quot;give me a
plank and I will run on it, so will Amanieu.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ogier looked ruefully at the crosses.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis a pity,&quot; said he. &quot;I intended to cut a dozen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If the visitor to the Eglise de Guillem will look, to
this day, rudely hacked in the floor, he will see the
ten crosses: he will see further&mdash;but we will leave the
rest to the sequel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="center">THREE CROSSES.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">No</span> sooner had Noémi left <i>l&#39;église</i> than with her
teeth she tore the red cross off her left shoulder in an
ebullition of wrathful resentment.</p>

<p class="indent">She rode, attended by the two servants of the
Tardes, to La Roque Gageac without speaking.</p>

<p class="indent">Her mind was busy. It was clear to her that she
could not remain with her aunt after that affair at the
Devil&#39;s Table. The Bishop of Sarlat was not an energetic
ruler; he might demur to making an expedition
against Domme, doubt the expediency of attempting
reprisals against so terrible a man as Le Gros Guillem,
and all for the sake of a Jew, but he could hardly
allow her, who had been the mover in the robbery, to
remain in one of his towns. It would not be well for
her to compromise the Tarde family. She must go to
her mother at Domme.</p>

<p class="indent">On arriving at La Roque, she told Jacques and
Jean Tarde what she had done.</p>

<p class="indent">Jacques burst out laughing. &quot;Well done, Cousin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
Noémi! I am glad our money has gone to some good
purpose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She flushed to her temples. Jean del&#39; Peyra had
not welcomed her with commendation. He had received
what she had done in an ungracious manner.
She resented this. She was bitter at heart against
him. That was the last time she would move a finger
to help a Del&#39; Peyra.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi remained the night and part of next day
at La Roque. Though young and strong, she was
greatly tired by the exertion she had gone through,
and by the mental excitement even more than the
bodily exertion. The distance to Domme was not
great. She had but to cross the Dordogne a couple
of leagues higher in a ferry-boat and she would be at
the foot of the rock of Domme. This rock may be
described as an oval snuffbox with precipitous sides,
flat, or nearly so, above, with, however, one end somewhat
elevated above the other. On this superior elevation
stood the castle or citadel. On the lower was the
town, uniformly built, with a quadrangular market-place
in the midst surrounded by arcades, and every
street cutting another at right angles, and every house
an exact counterpart of its fellow.</p>

<p class="indent">The garrison kept guard on the walls, but their
headquarters were in the castle, where also resided their
Captain, Guillem. Access to the town was to be had
by one way only, and the gate was strongly defended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
by salient drums of towers. The castle had a triple
defence of river, wall and half towers, and possessed a
great donjon, square and machicolated. In 1369 it
had stood a siege by the English for fifteen days, and
had repelled Sir John Chandos and all his force.
Since then it had fallen into the hands of the English
through the neglect of the French crown to provide
the necessary garrison.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi was attended as far as Domme by her cousins&#39;
servant. On reaching the town it was at once
manifest that something unusual had occurred which
was occupying the minds and tongues of the townspeople.
The men were gathered in knots; the arcaded
market-place was full of them.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl entered the castle and proceeded to her
mother&#39;s room. This lady was past the middle age,
finely framed and delicately featured, still beautiful,
but languid and desponding. She greeted her daughter
without impulsive affection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi,&quot; she said, &quot;something has happened to
discompose your father. I do not know what it is,
the whole place is in commotion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will go see,&quot; answered the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not think he wishes to be disturbed,&quot; said
the lady, and sighing, leaned back in her seat.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi at once proceeded to the chamber usually
occupied by Guillem, and she saw him there, seated at
a table, gnawing his nails.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
The insolent, dauntless freebooter was much altered.
He sat with his elbows on the table, his fingers
to his teeth, his hair ragged, his tall, smooth
head, usually polished, without its wonted gloss, his
eyes staring stonily before him.</p>

<p class="indent">The Captain was mortified rather than hurt. He
had been driven like a wolf athwart the woods by the
peasants; smoked out of his lair by Jacques Bonhomme,
like a fox.</p>

<p class="indent">He had escaped from the &quot;Church&quot; by the skin
of his teeth. Roused by the crashing in of the roof,
then by the flood of fire, he had sprung from his bed,
half-clothed, without his jerkin and boots, had seized
his sword and had fled. In an instant he had realised
the impossibility of resistance, and had run along the
<i>mal-pas</i>, and, selfish in his fear, had kicked down the
plank over the chasm to secure himself from pursuit,
though at the sacrifice of his men.</p>

<p class="indent">He had lurked at a distance, watching his blazing
castle and then had run on. Occasionally he had all
but rushed into the arms of peasants flocking from
the neighbourhood. Once, in the grey morning light,
he had been recognised and pursued, and had only
saved himself by cowering under an overhanging
stone till the men had gone by.</p>

<p class="indent">Bootless, running over rocks and stones, and these
latter in many cases flints that were broken and cut
like razors, his feet had been gashed, and he had at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
length been hardly able to limp along. Prickles of
briar, spines of juniper, had aggravated the wounds,
and it was with extreme difficulty that he had reached
the Dordogne, seized a boat, and rowed himself across
into territory nominally English. Even then he had
not been safe. He knew it. He must reach Domme
before the tidings of the disaster arrived, or all the
subjugated country would be roused. He broke into
a farmer&#39;s stable, took his horse, and galloped with it
up the valley, nor halted till he reached the gates of
Domme, where his warder opened to him in amaze to
see the governor of the town, the captain of the garrison,
arrive in such a deplorable condition.</p>

<p class="indent">Since his arrival, after he had bathed his feet and
had them bound up, he had been seated at his table,
gnawing his nails, glaring into space, his heart eaten
out with rage, humiliation, and raven for revenge.</p>

<p class="indent">To have been defied by a Del&#39; Peyra! To have
been warned by his adversary and not to have profited
by the warning! Guillem&#39;s bald forehead smoked, so
hot were his thoughts within him.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi stood looking at the Captain, amazed at
the change that had come over him&mdash;at his haggardness,
at his stoniness of eye.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father, what has happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go away! I want no women here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, father, something has taken place. All
Domme is in commotion. The streets are full.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
&quot;Full!&quot; in a scream; &quot;talking of me&mdash;of my disgrace!
Call my lieutenant; I will send the pikemen
through the streets to clear them&mdash;to silence the chattering
rogues.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what does this all mean, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come here, child.&quot; He waved his arm without
looking at her. She obeyed. She stepped to his side
and stood by the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father, your fingers are bleeding; you have
gnawed them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have I? It matters not. My feet are bleeding,
my brain is bleeding, my honour is bled to death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took her hand. The only soft part in this
terrible man was his love for Noémi, and that was
rarely shown.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are the Del&#39; Peyras to you?&quot; he asked
roughly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing, father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked round, caught her steady eye, winced,
and turned his away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So&mdash;nothing. Why did you then ransom these
men?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because, father, I had pity for the men themselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&quot; He could not understand this simple,
natural, elementary feeling. She did not answer him,
but loosened her hand from his; she took the torn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
strips of red silk that had formed her cross and put
them on the table before him. &quot;I renounce my companionship,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">He did not regard her words or her action.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad the Del&#39; Peyras are nothing to you.
I swear&mdash;&mdash;&quot; He sprang up but sank again. He
could not bear to stand on his mangled feet. &quot;I
swear to you, I swear to all Périgord I will root them
out; I will not leave a fibre of them anywhere. I
will let all the world know what it is to oppose me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has been done, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again he turned his face, but could not endure
her clear eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot tell you. Ask others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Steps were audible in the anteroom, and Roger
and Amanieu entered. They saluted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Captain,&quot; said Roger, &quot;we only are come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the others?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ten of them&mdash;made to leap the beam.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Captain, and the Seigneur del&#39; Peyra sent
his compliments to you, and was sorry your legs were
so long. You&#39;ll excuse me, Captain, they were his
own words; he made me swear to repeat them. He
was very sorry your legs were so long. He cut ten
crosses in the stone, one for each of the comrades,
and, said he, there was room for another, and he&#39;ll do
you the honour of making its legs long also, if he has
the chance of catching you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
Guillem gnashed his teeth; the blood rushed into
his eyes. He glared at the messenger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think, Captain, you might have left us the
plank,&quot; said Amanieu. &quot;As it was, we had to borrow
one from the peasants.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Send me the lieutenant. This can only be wiped
out in blood!&quot; roared the Gros Guillem, in spite of
his wounded feet, leaping into an upright position.
&quot;I care not that I am lamed&mdash;I care not&mdash;I shall be
lifted into my saddle. I will not eat, I will not sleep
till I have revenged myself and the murdered ten,
and my burnt castle and this outrage on my honour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am here, Captain,&quot; said the lieutenant, stepping
forward. He had entered along with the returned
companions. In the blindness of his agony
of mind and rage Guillem had not noticed him.</p>

<p class="indent">The filibuster turned his face to the lieutenant.
It was terrible. His red but grizzled hair, uncombed,
shaggy with sweat, electrified and bristling with the
fury that was in him, his pale eyes and red suffused
balls, his great mouth with pointed fangs, the lower
jaw quivering with excitement, made his appearance
terrible.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lieutenant!&quot; shouted Guillem; &quot;call out all
the men available&mdash;all but such as must remain to
guard the castle and this cursed disloyal town, in
which every citizen is a traitor. Muster them outside
the castle; bring forth as many horses as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
have. If I am carried, I will go. At once, before
these peasants have recovered their astonishment, because
they surprised us when we were asleep: at
once, as swiftly as possible, to chastise them. Cut
down every peasant in arms: give no quarter, but
above all, take me Ogier del&#39; Peyra. I will pay fifty
livres for him&mdash;to any man&mdash;to have him taken alive.
I do not desire him dead; I must have him alive.
Do you mark me? First of all, Del&#39; Peyra. At once,
before they expect reprisals&mdash;at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His hand was on the table. In his fury he shook
it as if it had been his enemy he was grappling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To horse, Roger and Amanieu, and revenge your
wrongs, as I will revenge mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me, Captain,&quot; said Roger. &quot;What is
this I see? the red silk cross&mdash;what? has she taken
this off and renounced companionship? So do I. I
cannot serve against the father Del&#39; Peyra or the son
who spared my life.&quot; He plucked at the cross on his
shoulder, then with his dagger unripped it, tore it,
and threw it on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor I,&quot; said Amanieu surlily, &quot;not because they
spared me, but because you kicked down the plank.&quot;
And he also tore off his cross and flung it on the
table.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="center">THE END OF L&#39;EGLISE GUILLEM.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> exultation of the peasants at having taken
&quot;the Church of Guillem&quot; would have resulted in a
sack and insubordination but for two causes: one,
that the spoil of the robbers had not been recovered;
and the other, the great firmness of Jean del&#39; Peyra
and his father.</p>

<p class="indent">The pillaged goods must be found. None had
much hesitation in saying where they were. Everything
worth preserving had been stowed away in the
rock-hewn chamber above the castle, in the face of
the cliff, and this was now very difficult of access.</p>

<p class="indent">The roof of the castle from which it was reached
was broken in, portions had been consumed, other
portions were so charred as to be dangerous.</p>

<p class="indent">The peasants had begun to throw down the walls,
to demolish every portion of the structure that was
artificial, but Jean stayed them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you do this,&quot; said he, &quot;how shall we reach
the treasury above?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
The day had broken but the sun had not yet risen.
The slope below the Church and the Church itself
presented a strange spectacle.</p>

<p class="indent">The incline was strewn with smouldering fragments
of wood, of faggots, the bind of which had
been burst by the flames, and had released sticks that
had not been ignited, of rafters from the castle blackened
by the fire, of long streams of pitch that had
fallen and run and had ceased to flame. In the midst
of the road by the river-brim stood a cask on its
bottom, emitting volumes of black smoke. Amid
the wreckage lay the corpses of the men who had
been made to leap to their death. When daylight
came, it was perceived that one alone had not died
instantly. He had been seen to stir an arm and
raise his head, and a peasant had run down and dispatched
him.</p>

<p class="indent">The face of the cliff, wherever reached by the
flames, had become decomposed. Chalk will not endure
the touch of fire, and the white, scaly surface
had flaked off and exposed yellow patches like sandstone.
Scales, moreover, were continually falling
from the blistered scar.</p>

<p class="indent">A portion of the floor of the main chamber of the
castle that projected beyond the face of the cliff remained
unconsumed, and sustained the beams of the
wall that formed the screen in front. Many of the
stones that had been inserted between the rafters had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
fallen out; nevertheless, sufficient remained to make
it possible for an agile man to reach the charred and
ruinous roof.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let some go to the cliff-edge overhead,&quot; said
Jean, &quot;and tie the end of a rope to a tree, and let it
down in front of the chamber in the rock. Then I
can, I believe, climb to it, and see! I will thrust this
piece of torn red silk through the roof at the end of
a pike, as a token where to lower the cord.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">An hour elapsed before the rope end with a heavy
stone attached to it came down through the shattered
roof. This was now left hanging, and Jean del&#39; Peyra
began to climb. He bade the men undo the stone as
soon as he was aloft, and in its place attach a large
basket to the cord, which he would draw up and fill
with whatever he found in the chamber. Knowing,
however, how little the peasants could be trusted,
he required his father to keep guard, and take possession
of what he lowered, the whole to be retained
undisturbed till each could claim his own goods,
and of those unclaimed a distribution would be
made later among such as had assisted in taking the
stronghold.</p>

<p class="indent">Nimbly as a cat Jean ascended among the beams.
He had to use extreme caution, as some of them were
smoking, and he had to beware of putting his hand
on fire that was unobservable by daylight, and of resting
his foot on cross pieces that had been reduced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
charcoal. The stones shaken by him as he mounted,
and loosely compacted among half-burnt beams, and
themselves split and powdered with heat, came down
in volleys; but as this portion of the castle overhung
the precipice from seven to ten feet, they did not
jeopardise those who were in the cavernous part of
the chamber.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean rapidly swung himself to the rafters of the
roof, and, after testing which would bear his weight,
crept along one till he touched the cord. Then, by
this aid, he was able to creep up the face of the rock,
that, however, came down on him in dust where crumbled
by the heat; and in a couple of minutes he was
in the cave.</p>

<p class="indent">A rapid glance round assured him that it was untenanted,
and that it contained all the booty that
had been accumulated by the <i>routiers</i> in many excursions.</p>

<p class="indent">In lockers cut in the native rock, and furnished
with wooden shelves, were gold chalices and reliquaries
of Limoges enamel, silver-tipped drinking-horns,
and a richly bound volume of poetry, the interminable
metrical romance of Guerin de Montglane.
In chests were silks and velvets; in boxes the jewellery
of ladies. Besides these costly articles were many
of inferior value, garments, boots, gloves, caps, of every
sort and quality. Of money there was not much, save
one bag that contained a hundred livres&mdash;it was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
ransom of the seven men, the plunder of the Jew
Levi.</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as Jean had passed everything down to
the men below by means of his basket, that travelled
frequently up and down, he took hold of the rope and
easily swung himself to the rafters, and let himself
down into the chamber of the castle. Here his father
had disposed of the booty in parcels, and had arranged
that all was to be carried down the hill and deposited
in the Church of Ste. Soure, where division would
be made in three days&#39; time. Then every claimant
should be satisfied. Those sacred vessels which had
come from churches would be restored to the churches,
and notice would be issued to all sufferers in the country
round to come and retake whatsoever they could
show was legitimately their own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, father,&quot; said Jean, &quot;it seems to me
that we are but at the beginning of our troubles. We
have taken this outpost and destroyed a handful of
our oppressors. But behind this stands Domme, and
in it is a garrison. The Captain has slipped through
our fingers. He will never consent to abide without
an attempt to recover what is lost and to revenge his
humiliation. It is my advice that we utterly destroy
this castle, so that it can never be occupied again.
Then, that we should send out spies to observe the
movements of the enemy, and report if he be on his
way to make reprisals. Lastly, that we hold ourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
in readiness to encounter him when he sets forth.
Let us choose our own ground, and that is half-way
to success.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right, Jean,&quot; said the old man. &quot;We
will take council at noon and prepare. Now, lads!
down with the walls, rip up the floors, down with
everything! Remember this&mdash;a first advantage is a
sure prelude to a final disaster unless followed up.
Do you know why we have taken and destroyed this
&#39;Church&#39;? Because the ruffians had surprised us
and made easy spoil at Ste. Soure. They sat down
here to eat and drink and lay down to sleep in full
confidence that we were overawed. Now we have
surprised them. Take care lest what chanced to
them chance also to us. At noon meet in the Ste.
Soure church. Now to work. Down with the rest
of the twigs of this vultures&#39; nest!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a cheer the men set to work to demolish the
castle that had so long menaced the country. There
were many willing hands employed, and the work was
already half done; it needed little more than some
shaking to throw the entire structure to pieces. Only
here and there was there solid wall; that here and
there was where there was solid shelf on which to
build. Elsewhere all was wooden framework filled
with stones.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus was L&#39;Eglise Guillem destroyed. At the
same time some great thing was won. The people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
spasmodically, had exerted its power, and had acquired
consciousness of its strength; it held up for a
moment the head that had been for so many centuries
bowed under the feet of its tyrants. It had looked
military power in the face, and had not winced.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="center">THE BATTLE OF THE BEUNE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Le Gros Guillem</span>, at the head of fifty men, was
on his way to chastise the peasants of the Vézère
Valley.</p>

<p class="indent">The number he had with him was not large, but
he was unable to spare more for this expedition. A
sufficient garrison must be left in Domme. Besides,
to deal with peasants, a handful of soldiers with steel
caps and swords was certain to suffice; hitherto it had
sufficed, and that at all times. What was Del&#39; Peyra?
He had never distinguished himself in feats of arms;
no one had ever heard that he had taken them up at
any time. The dung-fork and the ox-goad befitted
him. It was said he had more than once ploughed
his own land.</p>

<p class="indent">The men were mounted so as to make the <i>chevauchée</i>
as rapidly and effectively as possible, without
allowing those whom they were resolved to attack
time to bestir themselves and assemble to offer resistance.
If these Ste. Soure peasants did learn that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
<i>ribauds</i> were coming they would flee to the rocks and
hide themselves there. That they should attempt resistance
was not to be anticipated. Guillem had determined
to burn every house in the village, to devastate
the fields, cut down all the fruit-trees, and try
whether fire and an escalade would enable him to capture
Le Peuch, the stronghold of the Del&#39; Peyras, so
that he might be able to punish the chief offender,
the Seigneur Ogier, as well as all his retainers and
vassals.</p>

<p class="indent">The Captain alone was silent and immersed in
gloomy thoughts. The rest of the Company were
merry and indulged in banter. They were bound on
an expedition of all others best to their liking.</p>

<p class="indent">As they descended the valley of the Little Beune
they passed under the rock of Cazelles, and looked up
with a laugh at the peasants who were peering out of
the holes of the cliff, much like jackdaws. Not a
bullock, not a sheep was left in the valley. The
houses were deserted, and probably everything that
could be carried away had been transmitted to the
cave refuges.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look!&quot; mocked one of the riders. &quot;The fellows
had such a scare the other day at Ste. Soure that
these villains at Cazelles have not yet recovered confidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Where the Little Beune unites with the Great
Beune the blended calcareous waters ooze through bog
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
in a dreamlike, purposeless manner round a shoulder
of rock that is precipitous, but which has a sufficiency
of solid ground at its feet to allow of a practicable
way being carried over this deposit.</p>

<p class="indent">The Beune and the Vézère are like two different
types of character. The latter never deviates from
the direction it has resolved on taking except when
opposed by obstacles impossible to overleap, and these
it circumvents. It saws down every barrier it can;
it never halts for a moment; if it turns back in the
direction it has been pursuing it is solely that it may
seek out a channel more direct and less tortuous. It
is so with men and women who have a clear conception
of an object at which they are aiming, some purpose
in their lives.</p>

<p class="indent">With the Beune it is otherwise. It has no perceptible
current; it does not run; it has no flow; it
slips down. It finds itself in a channel and drifts
along from one stagnation to another; it has had
nothing whatever to do with the formation of its
channel. It does not even lie in a bed of its own
making. It is a bog and not a river&mdash;here and there
spreading into pools that wait for an impulse to be
given them by the wind, by the whisk of a heron&#39;s
wing, to form the ripple that will carry some of its
water over the calcareous bar it has itself raised by
its own inertness. No one could say, looking at the
Beune, in which direction it was tending, and it does
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
not seem to have any idea itself. Its sluggishness
accumulates obstacles; marsh grass is given time to
throw out its fibrous roots, and reeds to build up
hurdles across the stream, and the cretaceous particles
settle at leisure into walls obstructing it; consequently
diverting it. It lurches stupidly from side
to side and then listlessly gives up every effort of advance.
We stoop to drink of the Vézère. We turn
in disgust from the Beune.</p>

<p class="indent">On each side of the Vézère as it swings along is
alluvial soil&mdash;beds of the utmost richness that laugh
with verdure, where the hay harvest is gathered thrice
in the year. In the equally broad valley of the Beune
is no pasture at all, nothing good, nothing but profitless
morass. Where the waters touch good soil they
corrupt it. The crystal waters of the Vézère nourish
every herb they reach; the turbid ooze of the Beune
kills, petrifies all life that approaches it.</p>

<p class="indent">Is not this also a picture of certain characters?
Characters!&mdash;save the mark! Characterless individuals
that we have seen, perhaps have to do with, whom
we avoid when possible.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>

Within the last five years a determined effort has been
made to reclaim the valley of the Beune. To do this, a
channel has been cut for the river, that has to be incessantly
cleared.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Hardly had the band of <i>routiers</i> turned into the
main valley, and the foremost men had reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
cliff, before a horn was blown, and at once a shower
of stones was hurled from above the horsemen.</p>

<p class="indent">At the same moment they saw that the road before
them was barricaded. Trees had been felled and
thrown across the track, and from behind this barricade
scowled black faces and flashed weapons.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the horses reared, struck by the stones;
some of the riders were thrown to the ground. The
horses, frightened, bounded from the road. They
could not turn, being pressed on by those behind;
they rushed away from the shower of stones into the
level track of valley-bed on their right, and at once
foundered in the morass. There they plunged, endeavoured
to extricate themselves, and sank deeper.
The semi-petrified fibres through which their hoofs
sank, held to their legs, and prevented the beasts from
withdrawing them. After a few frantic and fruitless
efforts they sank to their bellies and remained motionless,
with that singular stolidity that comes over a
beast when it resigns itself to circumstances which it
recognises it has not the power to overcome.</p>

<p class="indent">The men who had been carried into the marsh
threw themselves off. The <i>routiers</i> were wiser than
were the knights at Agincourt. They did not overburden
themselves with defensive armour which would
weigh them down and render them incapable of movement.
Most of their clothing was of leather, with but
a little steel over their breasts and shoulders. With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
agility they threw themselves from their sinking
horses, and waded to the hard ground. At times
they floundered deep, but were able to throw themselves
forward and where the surface was most precarious,
advanced like lizards, till they reached ground
where the rushes showed that it was sufficiently compact
to sustain them upright.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, those in the rear who had halted when
the first ranks were broken and dispersed hesitated
what to do. To push forward was to incur the same
fate, and their pride would not suffer them to retreat.</p>

<p class="indent">The Captain was behind. He was suffering greatly.
His wounded feet had begun to inflame; they
were swollen and tortured by the compression of his
boots. He could not bear to rest his soles on the
stirrup-irons. To rise in his stirrups and hew with
his great sword, as he had purposed, was impossible.
The pain he endured fevered his blood, churned his
anger to frenzy, which this unexpected check did not
serve to moderate.</p>

<p class="indent">He had his wits about him, however, and he saw
that those who held the rock must be dislodged or no
advance could be made.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly, he ordered a party of his men to dismount,
peg their horses, and ascend to where the
peasants were threatening them with their piles of
stones.</p>

<p class="indent">This could be done&mdash;at all events attempted&mdash;from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
the lateral valley, where the slope was moderate
and densely overgrown with coppice.</p>

<p class="indent">Bitterly now did the leader regret that for a second
time he had underrated the spirit and the sagacity
of his opponents. He ought to have marched at
the head of a larger contingent or have postponed his
attempt till a more suitable opportunity presented
itself.</p>

<p class="indent">With his usual effrontery, Guillem had ridden
across country by the shortest way, through the lands
of the Bishop of Sarlat, instead of descending the
Dordogne to the junction of the Vézère, and then
ascending the latter river to Ste. Soure.</p>

<p class="indent">He had not done this for two reasons&mdash;one was
that the formidable Castle of Beynac, in French
hands, blocked the passage down the Dordogne; the
other was that he had measured and properly appreciated
the incapacity of the prelate: he knew the
Bishop had not the men at his disposal to send to
contest his passage.</p>

<p class="indent">At this time his real danger lay, as he very well
knew, in tidings of his ride reaching the Castle of
Commarques, hardly an hour&#39;s distance up the valley
of the Great Beune. This was a dependence of Beynac,
and was held for the French king.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> What garrison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
was there he knew not, but it was certain to be
small. Nevertheless, even a small band of troopers or
experienced men-at-arms assailing him in rear while
engaged in bursting through this barrier of peasants
before him might be more than dangerous, it might
prove disastrous.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a>

This splendid ruin&mdash;one of the finest in Périgord&mdash;has
been recently purchased by the Prince de Croye, who is engaged
in cutting and constructing roads to it, with the purpose
of restoring the castle as a residence. A charming residence it
is likely to prove to such as are mosquito-proof.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Resolved at all hazards to dislodge those on the
height, he sent his lieutenant up the steep hillside at
the head of his trustiest men, or, rather, as many of
these as he could spare without breaking the ranks
directly opposed to those who watched and menaced
from behind the barricade.</p>

<p class="indent">But the task of storming the height was one that
was difficult. Not only was the party sent up it inadequate
in numbers, not only were the assailants inconvenienced
by the steepness of the ascent, but their
weapons were not calculated to be effective in a tangle
of chestnut, rowan, and sloe laced about with ropes of
bramble and clematis. They carried swords; they
were unprovided with pikes; whereas those who held
the height were armed with knives fastened to long
poles, which they could thrust with excellent effect
at the men who were attacking. Time was expended
in the scramble; and the assailants were exhausted
before they came within sight of the eyes of those
they were sent to dislodge. In the brushwood the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
<i>routiers</i> could not keep together; the many sprays
shooting up from stumps of felled chestnut separated
them. They had to hack their way through the tough
chains of clematis, and they were lacerated by the
thorns of the sloe-bushes and the teeth of the wild
rose and blackberry-briar. They could not come to a
hand-to-hand fight. Their enemies calmly waited,
watching them in their struggle, and drove at them
with their blades through the bushes, forcing them
to spring back to avoid death.</p>

<p class="indent">It took some time for the lieutenant in command
to realise that he had been dispatched on a task which
he was incompetent to achieve. But when he had
determined this, he bade his men desist and retreat to
the valley below.</p>

<p class="indent">They had not retreated far on their way down
before they saw that the aspect of affairs below was
greatly changed since they had started on their
scramble.</p>

<p class="indent">Behind the barricade had been ranged the charcoal-burners
with their forks, under the command of
Ogier del&#39; Peyra.</p>

<p class="indent">These had remained covered by their breastwork,
expecting the enemy to make a second attempt to advance
along the road. When, however, this was not
done, and they saw them drawn up motionless, and
shortly after heard the shouts and cries from the
height, then Ogier recognised that the line of men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
before him was covering an attack on his son, who
held the rock.</p>

<p class="indent">He at once gave the signal to advance at a rush.
With a shout of joy the charcoal-burners burst over
the barricade and charged along the road, led by the
Seigneur, and fell upon the double line of troopers.</p>

<p class="indent">A furious hand-to-hand mêlée ensued. The horses
were alarmed by the sable figures with black faces and
hands who sprang at them, and recoiled, not only
from the sight, but also at their smell, producing disorder.
The struggle that ensued was hand to hand.
No quarter was asked and none was given. The
<i>routiers</i> were borne back, several had fallen, but also
many colliers rolled on the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">At this juncture, down from the hill, out from
among the coppice leaped the contingent that had
failed to capture the height. It arrived at the most
critical moment, just as the horsemen were struggling
to disengage themselves and fly. They came upon
the colliers in rear, they stopped accessions to their
ranks from behind. Now their blades served them
well, and the rout that had begun was arrested.</p>

<p class="indent">The arrival of this body of men startled the peasants.
They did not understand whence they had
sprung; and they retreated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Turn! Back to Domme!&quot; yelled the Captain.</p>

<p class="indent">The men recovered their horses, remounted, and
still fighting, began the retreat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
As they came under Cazelles a shower of projectiles
was launched upon them from above.</p>

<p class="indent">The peasants gave over the pursuit. They were
incapable of keeping pace with the horses.</p>

<p class="indent">And now, as they fell back, down from the height
came Jean del&#39; Peyra with his men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is my father?&quot; he asked eagerly, and
looked round.</p>

<p class="indent">Old Ogier was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Search among the fallen!&quot; ordered Jean in great
alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">Every dead and dying man was examined.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came back a charcoal-burner, hot, for he had
been running, and the sweat streaming over his face
had washed it into streaks, like those that stain the
face of the chalk cliffs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&mdash;the Seigneur?&quot; asked the man. &quot;He is
taken.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Taken!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye, taken and carried away by the <i>rouffiens</i>.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="center">A THREATENED HORROR.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Gros Guillem returned to the Castle of
Domme, his feet were so swollen that the boots had
to be cut off, and his feet swathed in linen.</p>

<p class="indent">By his orders, Ogier del&#39; Peyra was thrown into
a dungeon for the night. The old Seigneur had been
surrounded, disarmed, and captured by some of the
<i>routiers</i> while recovering their horses, which Ogier
was endeavouring to prevent by cutting their reins.</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as he was taken he knew that his doom
was sealed, and he bore the knowledge with his usual
stolidity, amounting to indifference. A quiet, plodding,
heavy man he had ever been, only notable for
his rectitude in the midst of a tortuous generation;
he had been roused to energy and almost savagery by
circumstances, and, thus roused, had manifested a
power and prevision which no one had expected to
find in him. Now that all was done that he could do,
he slid back into his ordinary quietude. He slept
soundly in his prison, for he had greatly excited and
tired himself during the day.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
&quot;Man can die but once,&quot; he said; and the saying
was characteristic of the man&mdash;it was commonplace.
This was, perhaps, less the case when he added, &quot;An
honest conscience can look Death in the face without
blushing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Consequently, when thrust into his dungeon, he
took the blanket ungraciously afforded him, and
wrapped it round him, ate his portion of bread, drank
a draught of water, signed himself&mdash;said the peasant&#39;s
prayer, common in Quercy and Périgord as in England&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Then he threw up his feet on the board that was
given him for bed, and in five minutes slept and
snored.</p>

<p class="indent">It was otherwise with Le Gros Guillem. He
would tolerate no one near him but his wife and
daughter, and they came in for explosions of wrath.
The fever caused by pain had inflamed his head: he
talked, swore, raged against everyone and all things,
and boasted of the example he would make on the
morrow of the man who was in his power. Noémi
knew that some expedition had been undertaken, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
that it had failed, but she knew no particulars, certainly
had no idea that it had resulted in the capture
of Jean del&#39; Peyra&#39;s father.</p>

<p class="indent">She bathed and bound up her father&#39;s feet, and
applied cold water as often as they began to burn.
This gradually eased him, especially as he lay with
his feet raised. The wounds he had received were of
no great depth, but they were painful, because the
soles of the feet are especially sensitive; and as all
the grit and thorns had been removed by the surgeon
before he left Domme, there was no fear but that
with rest he would be well again in a week or ten
days; well enough at least to walk a little.</p>

<p class="indent">The wife of Gros Guillem was a dreamy, desponding
woman, who paid no attention to what he said,
interested herself in no way in his affairs; neither
stirring him to deeds of violence nor interfering to
mitigate the miseries wrought by him. She accepted
her position placidly. She was fond of Guillem in
her fashion without being demonstrative, and it was
a marvel to everyone how it was that he was so attached
to her, and that she had maintained her hold
on him through so many years.</p>

<p class="indent">It was reported, and the report was true, that
the lady had been carried off by Guillem from the
Castle of Fénelon. Guillem had retained her, in defiance
of the excommunication launched at him by the
Bishop of Cahors, and in defiance of the more trenchant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
and material weapons wielded against him by
the Fénelon family, which was powerful in Quercy,
and had a fortress on the Dordogne above Domme,
and a house and rock castle above La Roque Gageac,
side by side with that belonging to the Bishop of
Sarlat. In an affray with Guillem&#39;s company the
husband had been killed; the widow accepted this
fact as she had accepted the fact that she had been
carried off by violence. She sighed, lamented, pitied
herself as a veritable martyr, and acquiesced in being
the wife of the man who, though he had not killed
her husband with his own hand, had caused his
death.</p>

<p class="indent">With morning Guillem was easier and his head
cooler, but there was no alteration in his resolve with
regard to Del&#39; Peyra. He would deal with him in
such a signal manner as would from henceforth deter
any man from lifting a finger against himself.</p>

<p class="indent">In his fever he had racked his brain to consider
in what manner he would treat him.</p>

<p class="indent">He sent for his lieutenant and ordered that he
should himself be carried into the keep.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And,&quot; said he, &quot;bring up the prisoner&mdash;and call
up the men, into the lower dungeon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi was walking on the terrace of the castle
that same morning; she had been up late, had attended
to the fevered man, her father, and now was
sauntering in the cool under the shade of the lime-trees,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
clipped <i>en berceau</i>, that occupied the walk on
the walls&mdash;a walk that commanded the glorious valley
of the Dordogne, that wondrous river which flows
through some of the most beautiful and wild scenery
in Europe, and is also the most neglected by the traveller
in quest of beauty and novelty.</p>

<p class="indent">At this time she knew something of the events of
the previous day. She knew also of the taking and
the destruction of l&#39;Eglise Guillem. Twice had the
Del&#39; Peyras measured their strength against the redoubted
Captain, and twice had they forced him to
fly. At the head of raw peasants without rudimentary
discipline they had defied and beaten the troopers
of a hundred skirmishes. She was not surprised.
She had seen Rossignol. Great wrongs wake corresponding
forces that must expend themselves on the
wrong-doers. It is but a matter of time before the
thunder-cloud bursts. Every crime committed sends
up its steam to swell the vaporous masses and carries
with it the lightning.</p>

<p class="indent">Nursed though Noémi had been in an atmosphere
of violence, hearing of it as matter for exultation,
the ruin of households and homesteads spoken of as a
matter of course, she had never been brought face to
face with the wreckage till she was shown it at Ste.
Soure.</p>

<p class="indent">And did she feel anger against the Del&#39; Peyras for
having taken up arms to revenge their wrongs?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
Nothing was more natural: nothing more just where
the Crown and law were powerless, than that men
should right themselves. She would have despised
the Del&#39; Peyras had they sat down under their wrong
without any attempt to repay it.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi&#39;s nature was a good one, but it was undisciplined.
Her mother had allowed her to go her own
way. Her father treated her with indulgence, and
that precisely where she should have been checked.</p>

<p class="indent">In a lawless society she had learned to fear neither
God nor the king. Both were too far off. The one
in Heaven, the other in England; too distant to
rule effectively. A certain perfunctory homage was
claimed by both, neither was regarded as exercising
any control over men. A feudal service was all that a
bandit in those days, or indeed any baron or seigneur,
thought of rendering to the Almighty. He would
fight in a crusade for Him, he would do knightly
homage in church, but he would no more obey the
laws of the Christian religion than he would those of
the realm of France.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi had seen but little of Jean del&#39; Peyra, and
yet that little had surprised her, and had awoke in her
thoughts that were to her strange, and yet, though
strange, consonant with her instinctive sense of what
was right and wrong.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean del&#39; Peyra not only surprised her, but occupied
her thoughts: she saw, almost for the first time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
in him one of a different order from the men with
whom she had been thrown. Even her cousins, the
Tardes, were akin in mind and consciencelessness to
the <i>routiers.</i>What they did that was right was done
rather out of blind obedience to instinct, or allegiance
to their feudal lord, the Bishop of Sarlat. They were
noble, for they had escutcheons over their doors, but
all their nobility was external. They were boastful,
empty roysterers.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other hand, the Del&#39; Peyras were quiet,
made no pretence to being more than they were, and
were inspired with a moral sense and a regard for
their fellow-men.</p>

<p class="indent">She saw how far greater was the influence exerted
by the old man and his son than was exercised by that
remorseless man of war, Guillem, or the braggart
Jacques Tarde. Her father controlled men by fear;
Ogier del&#39; Peyra moved men by respect. The Captain
was a destructive, and only a destructive element.
Solely by means of men like the Del&#39; Peyras could
human happiness and well-being be built up.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi was a thoughtful girl.</p>

<p class="indent">At first, somewhat contemptuously, she had set
down Jean del&#39; Peyra as a milksop; from what she
had heard, his father was but a country clown. But
the country clown and the milksop had revealed
in themselves a force, an energy quite unexpected.
Noémi laughed as her busy mind worked. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
laughed to think of the discomfiture of professional
fighting men, accustomed to arms from their youth,
by a parcel of inexperienced peasants and charcoal-burners.</p>

<p class="indent">She was glad that these oppressed beings had
risen. It showed that there was in them a nature
above that of rabbits. She had seen a thousand times
the holes into which they ran at the glint of a spearhead,
at the jangle of a spur. But now they had
issued from their holes and had hunted like wolves.</p>

<p class="indent">But these poor, ignorant timid peasants would
never have done this had they not been led. It was
the moral character, the true nobility of the Del&#39;
Peyras that had rallied the people around them,
given them courage, and directed their blind impulse
of revenge into proper forms of retaliation.</p>

<p class="indent">Was the execution of those ten men of her
father&#39;s band to be accounted a wanton act of
cruelty?</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi could not admit this. Some such rude
administration of justice was rendered necessary by
the times. The men who had suffered had merited
their death by a hundred deeds of barbarity.</p>

<p class="indent">It was as though a spell had fallen on the girl.
She was exultant, her heart was bounding with pride,
and that because her father and his ruffians had been
put to rout by their adversaries.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl was unable to explain to herself the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
reason of this, but, indeed, she did not admit to
herself that it was as has been described. Yet
she was sensible that some spell was on her. She
had proposed to cast one on Jean. That kiss
she had given him had been intended to work the
charm. But, alack! there are dangerous spells which
a witch may weave that affect herself as much as her
victim, and of such was even this.</p>

<p class="indent">As Noémi paced the terrace, her mind in a ferment,
she was accosted by Roger, the good-natured,
somewhat impudent fellow who had attended her on
her expedition to the Devil&#39;s Table.</p>

<p class="indent">He had torn off his red cross, but he had not left
Domme, nor, indeed, the castle. He would no
longer share in an expedition against Ste. Soure, but
he was not unwilling to do any other service for the
Captain.</p>

<p class="indent">He could now exult over his comrades who had
returned from such an expedition with diminished
numbers, defeated.</p>

<p class="indent">He approached the girl and accosted her.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi answered curtly that she did not desire
to speak to him. She disliked the forwardness of the
man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But,&quot; said he, &quot;I would save his life&mdash;he saved
mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Save whom?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Seigneur del&#39; Peyra.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
&quot;What of him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was taken yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Seigneur&mdash;taken!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the Captain is now with him&mdash;in the dungeon
under the keep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doing what?&quot; asked Noémi in breathless alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is none in the world can save him but
yourself; the Captain would listen to no one else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Save him&mdash;from what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The <i>oubliette</i>.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="center">VADE IN PACE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> thought of undefined horror conveyed by
that word &quot;<i>oubliette</i>&quot; for a moment held Noémi
as though it had paralysed her. But this was for a
moment only, and then she bounded in the direction
of the keep.</p>

<p class="indent">A word must be said as to what an <i>oubliette</i> was.
In almost every mediæval castle in France and Germany
the visitor is shown holes, usually in the floor,
that descend to a considerable depth, and which are said
to be <i>oubliettes</i>&mdash;that is to say, places down which
prisoners were dropped when it was to the interest of
the lord of the castle to sink them in oblivion.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes these places communicate with a river
or a lake, as at Chillon, and this passage is set with
irons, presumably to cut in pieces the body of the
man cast down it.</p>

<p class="indent">In the vast majority of cases these so-called <i>oubliettes</i>
are nothing but openings connected with the
drainage of the castle or else are the well-mouths of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
cisterns in which the rain-water from the roofs was
collected and stored.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, the fact that skeletons have been
found in some of the closed subterranean vaults, and
that a percentage of them cannot be explained as
having been anything else but receptacles for prisoners
thrown in, to die a languishing death, and lastly,
the historic certainty that some poor wretches have so
perished, shows that popular belief is not wholly unfounded.
The writer has himself been let down by
ropes into one in which four skeletons were entombed,
and it is well known that in 1403 one of the Counts
of Armagnac so disposed of his cousin, who lingered
on thus immured for eight days. The son would
have shared his father&#39;s fate but that out of horror
at the notion of being flung down the well on the
corpse of his father, the poor lad dropped dead on the
brink.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, under the title of <i>vade in pace</i>, the
<i>oubliette</i> was used, not in castles only, but in convents
as well, and was there introduced by Matthew, Prior
of St. Martin des Prés, in Languedoc, in the middle
of the fourteenth century, when the Archbishop of
Toulouse interfered to forbid the employment of this
inhuman mode of execution. A prelate might step
in to check the barbarity of a prior, but who was
there to hold the hand of a noble?</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi saw a cluster of men outside the door that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
led into the dungeon, and forced her way through
them. The dungeon was not large, it would not
admit more than a dozen men. It opened on to a
platform of rock on the outside of the castle, not into
the inner court. Access to it was obtained by a doorway
in the basement of the keep, where the wall was
ten feet thick. The chamber was vaulted, and only
near the middle sufficiently lofty to admit of anyone
standing upright in it. There was no window by
which light and air could penetrate. When the door
was shut, both were excluded. The walls, the floor,
the vault were of square-cut limestone.</p>

<p class="indent">At the further end, immediately opposite the door
was a recess, conchoidal, and in this recess what
seemed to be a well. There was a stone step in the
floor, and above that a circular coped wall, precisely
such as may be seen where there is a well; with this
difference, that the orifice was not two feet in diameter,
a very inconvenient size for a bucket to pass up
or down.</p>

<p class="indent">In the dungeon sat Le Gros Guillem on a pallet,
with his feet raised and bandaged. Before him,
bound, with his hands behind his back, was Ogier
del&#39; Peyra, between two jailers. The old man had
concluded that his head would be struck off, at the
worst that he would be hanged. The sight of the
<i>vade in pace</i>, and the knowledge that he was to
be cast down alive and left to a lingering agony,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
had blanched his cheek, but did not make him
tremble.</p>

<p class="indent">Ogier did not know, he could not guess, the depth
of the <i>oubliette.</i>But he was aware that such were
sometimes not so profound but that he who was flung
in broke some of his bones, and thus died of a combination
of miseries. Happy he who, falling on his
head, was reduced at once to unconsciousness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Del&#39; Peyra,&quot; cried Guillem, in his harsh
tones, rendered harsher by the feverishness and weariness
of the past night, &quot;will you not stoop to beg of
me your life?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is of no use,&quot; answered Ogier.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold the lights, that I may see him!&quot; ordered
the Captain.</p>

<p class="indent">Two of his men brought torches that emitted as
much smoke as light. In the dungeon, darkened by
the men crowding the door, artificial illumination was
necessary.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right there!&quot; shouted Guillem, in response
to the words of Ogier. &quot;I shall not spare
your life. But what think you of the mode of death?
Come, kneel, kiss my foot&mdash;wounded through you;
and I may consent to have you hanged instead of
thrown down yonder!&quot; He indicated the well-like
opening.</p>

<p class="indent">The glare of the torches was on Guillem&#39;s face as
much as on that of his prisoner. He was haggard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
with pain and mortified pride. He was but half-dressed,
was in his shirt, and his shirt was open over
his red, hairy breast. His tall, polished head shone
like copper in the lurid flicker of the links. His
great mouth, half open with a grim laugh, revealed
the teeth, pointed as though to bite and tear. He
was very thin, but muscular, and his limbs were long.
As already said, it was but in jest that he was entitled
&quot;Le Gros.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It may be questioned whether in the heart of a
single ruffian present there stirred the smallest emotion
of pity for the man who was to be sent to so
horrible a fate, for all had been humbled by Ogier,
and all angrily resented their humiliation. Moreover,
all desired to avenge their ten companions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold up the light, that I may see how he relishes
it!&quot; ordered Guillem, brutally. Then he said:
&quot;Pull off his boots, strip him to his shirt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But immediately he countermanded the order.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nay,&quot; said he, &quot;leave him his leather belt and
boots; he may satisfy his cravings on them. And,
Sieur Ogier, when you want more leather, call for my
boots. They have been cut to pieces, and are useless
to me. They may make a meal for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Captain looked steadily at his victim from
under his lowering eyebrows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How came you to think of resisting me?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
Ogier shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This execution will be noised everywhere,&quot; continued
Guillem. &quot;I shall take care of that. And
then every man will have a wholesome dread of me,
and a fear of resisting me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not my son Jean,&quot; retorted Ogier.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your son Jean comes next,&quot; said the Captain.
&quot;I shall deal with him presently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must catch him first,&quot; said Ogier.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take the prisoner to the hold!&quot; shouted Guillem.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the two jailers laid their hands on the shoulders
of Ogier del&#39; Peyra.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You need not drag me. I can walk,&quot; said the
old man.</p>

<p class="indent">Those crowding the close and narrow dungeon fell
back, as well as they were able, to make a passage for
the condemned man.</p>

<p class="indent">He was taken to the well-mouth and seated on it,
with his face towards the door, through which
glimpses of sunlight were visible athwart the heads
that filled the opening. Ogier had been divested of
his jerkin. He was in his shirt and breeches and
boots. As the Captain had bidden that his belt
should be left him, this had been refastened about his
waist, after that his coat had been removed. In order
to divest him of his outer garments it had been necessary
for the jailers to remove the handcuffs that had
fastened his arms behind his back.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
&quot;Cursed smoke!&quot; said Guillem. &quot;We are
smothered in the fume. Stand aside all of you and
let the fresh air enter, that we may breathe. Hearken,
Ogier! Will you yet ask life of me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At Guillem&#39;s command the men had stepped forth
and completely cleared the entrance, so that the brilliant
sunlight flowed in as well as the pure air. And
this light fell directly on the man who was soon to be
excluded for ever from it. He was seated on the well-mouth
in his white shirt. His face was as grey as
the thick hair of his beard. He was conscious that
he was looking for the last time at the light. He
could see intense blue sky, and one fleecy cloud in it.
He could see the green turf, and some yellow tansies
standing against a bit of wall in shade, the tansies in
full sunlight; and he could see a red admiral butterfly
hovering about them. It was marvellous how,
with death before him, he could yet distinguish so
much. But he looked at everything with a sort of
greed, because he saw all these things for the last
time. For the first and only moment in his life he
saw that a red admiral was beautiful, that the sky was
beautiful, the grass beautiful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have not answered me,&quot; said Le Gros Guillem,
sneering. &quot;Messire Ogier, will you yet ask life
of me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you were in my hands, as I am in yours, would
you ask that question?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
Le Gros Guillem paused one moment. Then with
an oath&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor I of you,&quot; said Ogier gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">Guillem raised his hands. The fingers were inordinately
long and thin. He made a sign to the
jailers, one of whom stood back, on each side of
Ogier, by the well-mouth, with his hand on the
shoulder of the prisoner. Each man, as was customary,
had his face covered&mdash;that is to say, a black sack
was drawn over his head, in which were two holes cut,
through which peered the eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Throw him down!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment, taking advantage of the avenue
made for the admission of air, Noémi rushed in. A
couple of men stepped forward to intercept her, but
she was too nimble for them; she was within almost
as soon as they thought of throwing themselves in
her way, and had cast herself upon Ogier and clasped
him with her arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father! Father! It cannot, it shall not be!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The door was filled again; the men crowded in to
see what new turn events would take, whether this
intervention would avail.</p>

<p class="indent">The jailers desisted as they were raising the old
man; they felt that the sight of the execution of the
sentence could not be permitted to a young girl.
Moreover, she held Del&#39; Peyra fast, and he could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
be extricated from her arms without the exercise of
force.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi!&quot; exclaimed Le Gros Guillem, throwing
his feet off the pallet, &quot;what is the meaning of this?
Why are you here? At once away! Do you hear
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will not let go! He shall not die! Father, it
cannot&mdash;it shall not be!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unloose her arms,&quot; ordered Guillem, and signed
to the men.</p>

<p class="indent">Firmly they obeyed. It was in vain that the girl
clung, writhed, endeavoured to disengage her arms
from their grasp, and clung to the condemned man.
They held her like a vice and drew her back from
the pit-mouth and interposed their persons between
her and the man she was endeavouring to save.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, in a paroxysm of horror and pity, Noémi
threw herself on her knees before her father and implored
him to yield.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is Del&#39; Peyra to you?&quot; he asked sternly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing&mdash;nothing,&quot; she gasped. &quot;Oh, father,
let him go! let him go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twice have you interfered between me and him.
Why is that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She could not answer his question; she did not attempt
to do so. She persisted in her entreaties. In
her anguish she caught hold of one of his injured
feet and made him cry out with pain.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
&quot;Father! If I have ever done anything for you!
If you have any love for me&mdash;any thought to do what
I wish&mdash;grant me this. Spare him! Spare him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never!&quot; answered Le Gros Guillem. Then
he waved his long hand and said, &quot;Remove this silly
girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But when Noémi felt hands laid on her, she
leaped to her feet, shook herself free, and said, panting&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let be! Do not touch me! I ask his life, no
more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do well, child,&quot; sneered the Captain.
&quot;You then run no more risk of disappointment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yet&mdash;if that be denied me, there is one thing I
do ask,&quot; gasped Noémi.</p>

<p class="indent">Her breath came as though she had been running
up hill. She put her hands to her head, and held it,
till she had recovered sufficiently to proceed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is one thing I do ask,&quot; she repeated.
&quot;Do not cast him down&mdash;let him down gently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A harsh laugh from Le Gros Guillem.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a silly child, a fool, who know not what
you ask. You will prolong his torture, not shorten it&mdash;but
you shall have your wish. Be it so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He waved to the jailers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go, child, go!&quot; said he to his daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will stay and see it done,&quot; she said. &quot;I will
not ask another thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
She stood erect and looked at the old man; her
mouth quivered, and her eyes were as though fixed
hard in their sockets like stones in a setting.</p>

<p class="indent">And the sight was one to freeze the blood.</p>

<p class="indent">The jailers raised Ogier, who offered no resistance,
but fixed his eyes strainingly on a spot of light above
a man&#39;s head in the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">He was lifted till his feet were above the well, and
then he was let down by ropes passed under his arms,
slowly, deliberately.</p>

<p class="indent">Those holding the torches raised them, and the
smoke described cabalistic devices on the roof. The
glare was on the sinking man.</p>

<p class="indent">He went down below his knees, then his waist disappeared.
Involuntarily he put forth his arms to
arrest his descent, by gripping the well-breast, but
recollected that resistance was in vain, and lowered
his arms to his sides.</p>

<p class="indent">Then his breast was hidden, then his shoulders
went under. For a moment all visible was the
ghastly grey face with the glittering eyes, and then&mdash;that
also was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">He uttered no cry, no groan, he went down like a
dead man, into profound darkness, into his living
tomb.</p>

<p class="indent">All was still in the dungeon, save for the labouring
breath of those who looked on. The jailers lowered
till the ropes became slack. Then they knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
the poor wretch was on the floor of the vault below.
Each man threw down one end of his rope and drew
at the other, even as at a funeral the ropes are withdrawn
when the dead has been lowered.</p>

<p class="indent">In the stillness, Guillem laughed&mdash;silently&mdash;showing
all his fangs, and waving his arms in the direction
of the <i>oubliette</i> mouth, and extending his lean fingers
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Vade in pace!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="center">IN THE RAVEN&#39;S NEST.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Le Gros Guillem was carried back to his
room, he said to his wife, &quot;Where is Noémi?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe&mdash;that is, I suppose she is going to her
Aunt Tarde at La Roque. She said something about
it. Something has occurred and she is not herself.
I don&#39;t know what it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare say!&quot; laughed the Captain. &quot;Noémi has
witnessed this day what has been seen by few girls.
She stood it manfully&mdash;at the last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare say. I know nothing about it,&quot; said his
wife.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If she is going to La Roque, then Roger and
Amanieu shall accompany her. I have a letter to
transmit to Ste. Soure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He sent for writing materials, and wrote in a
scrawling hand:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Dear and most valiant friend, Seigneur Jean del&#39;
Peyra at Le Peuch Ste. Soure.&mdash;Please you to know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
that your father is let down into oblivion. Dear and
well-loved Sir, God have you ever in guard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Written at Domme, Wednesday, and sent by the
hands of Roger and Amanieu.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">That was the fashion of epistolary correspondence
as conducted in those times. &quot;Dear friend&quot; was the
salutation to a deadly foe, &quot;God have you ever in
guard,&quot; when the writer would like to cut the throat
of him he addressed.</p>

<p class="indent">Such was the letter received by Jean del&#39; Peyra.
It was not explicit. He had been in the greatest
anxiety relative to his father. That he would be
put to ransom was his hope, but not his expectation.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked to the bearer of the epistle for explanation,
and then for the first time saw Noémi, her face
rigid and ghastly, as though she had seen a ghost, and
could not shake off the impression.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jean,&quot; she said, &quot;let them go back. I will tell
you all, between you and myself. No, not back. Step
aside.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Noémi saw that she and Jean were alone
she said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you not understand? Your father&mdash;he has
been let down into an <i>oubliette</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean started back as though he had been struck in
the face by a mailed hand.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
&quot;And now,&quot; proceeded Noémi, &quot;there is but one
chance for him, one way open to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where&mdash;where is it?&quot; gasped the lad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At Domme. No, you cannot storm that castle.
It has held out against French and English, and it
would hold out against your peasants.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean looked at her in silence. What other way
was open?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must go yourself to Domme,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And entreat for my father? We will sell all&mdash;land,
castle, seigneury&mdash;all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will not suffice. The Captain would take
you and cast you in where lies your unhappy
father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then what do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must take me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Along with me&mdash;to Domme?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, take and confine me here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&mdash;I saw it. I saw it at once when I was in
that horrible place, when my father refused to listen
to me and I pleaded for him. Then I saw clearly
there was no other chance for his life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And that is&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That you put me into the same position.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, in an <i>oubliette</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put me in a dungeon, and threaten unless your
father be restored, and back here safe by sunrise to-morow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
that you will cast me down as he has been
cast down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have no <i>oubliettes</i> here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have precipices.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean looked in astonishment at the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See, Jean!&quot; she said, and a dark spot came in
each cheek, &quot;by no other way can you rescue your
father than by going before <i>him</i>&mdash;I mean my father,
and threatening that unless your father be released
immediately, you will have me put to the same horrible
end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would never be done&mdash;never.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen to me, Jean. You must have me imprisoned
here. Place guards over me and go to my
father fearlessly. Say to him that the instant the first
spark of the sun lifts over yon hill&quot;&mdash;she pointed to
the heights opposite&mdash;&quot;if the Seigneur and you are
not here to stay their hands, you have told your
guards to throw me down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I were to threaten it, it would not be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it would. Do you suppose that your peasants
here and your armed men would spare me if they
knew that their Seigneur and his son had both been
sacrificed by Le Gros Guillem? They would tear me
to pieces. The women would stab me with their bodkins.
I had rather be dashed down the cliffs than that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
The young man remained silent, considering. The
girl&#39;s proposal did give him a hope of recovering his
father; the threat, which he did not for a moment
entertain the thought of executing, might, perhaps,
force the <i>routier</i> captain to surrender his prey.</p>

<p class="indent">Noémi plucked a ring from her finger and extended
it to Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see,&quot; said she, &quot;you will yield. Take this as
token to my father that I am here, as sign that your
menace is not an idle one. Now lead me away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the congeries of precipitous cliffs, like teeth,
that rise above Ste. Soure and go by the name of Le
Peuch, one possesses a rock-refuge of a peculiar character.
To reach it a steep ascent has to be effected up
an almost vertical piece of rock, in which places have
been cut for the feet. This climb gives access to a
grassy ledge. If this ledge be pursued, a buttress of
crag is reached that completely blocks the terrace.
But this has been scooped out, like a carious tooth, into
a chamber or guard-room. It is entered by a door
artificially cut, and he who explores the place there
finds himself in an apartment with a window dug
through the face looking south, and with sheer precipice
below it. At the back are seats cut in the stone.</p>

<p class="indent">Immediately opposite the entrance is another door,
communicating with another ledge, which, however,
does not extend more than ten feet, and ends in steep
cliff. Along the face of this cliff holes have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
scooped for the reception of the feet, so that a man
can walk along the front of the rock till he reaches a
projecting mass like that he has traversed, and this
mass is excavated into a series of chambers.</p>

<p class="indent">This rock-refuge is one that could not be taken, if
only moderate precautions were observed. The man
who passed in the socket-holes for his feet to the door
of the first chamber scooped out in the scar must traverse
in front of a window, through which it would
suffice for a child to thrust his hand to touch him to
upset his balance and send him headlong below to certain
death.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no place better calculated to serve as a
prison than this Raven&#39;s Nest, as it was called. Jean
was by no means sure that what Noémi said might not
come true; if the peasants learned who she was, they
might take advantage of his absence literally to tear
her to pieces, for they were greatly exasperated at the
loss of their master, the old Seigneur. If he were to
leave the girl for some hours at Le Peuch, she must
not only be protected against an attempt at recapture,
but against the resentment of his own people, who
might lose their heads when they found that he as well
as his father was lost to them. A woman like Rossignol&#39;s
wife was a firebrand inflamed with unslaked lust
for revenge. A few words from her might set all in
movement. The Southern Gauls are an impulsive,
excitable, and, when excited, an unreasoning people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
The <i>routiers</i> had not spared their wives and daughters,
why should they scruple about reprisals on the daughter
of their deadliest oppressor?</p>

<p class="indent">Distressed as Jean was at his father&#39;s fate, the
fear of what might happen to Noémi if left alone
at Le Peuch for a moment overbore his filial distress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must follow me,&quot; he said; and he beckoned
to the two men who had attended her to accompany
him as well.</p>

<p class="indent">Without further words he led them up the ascent,
along the ledge, and into the guard-room.</p>

<p class="indent">There he said to Amanieu and Roger&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your Captain&#39;s daughter is going to remain yonder.&quot;
He pointed across the gulf to the rock chambers
in the projecting mass of cliff. &quot;I shall not be
at Ste. Soure to protect her. You know what these
people are. Even you are not safe, though my father
granted you both your lives. As I see, you no longer
bear the brand of lawlessness. Do not concern yourself
about what takes me away. I leave you here in
guard of her. Let no one approach. Yonder, in those
retreats, there is always a supply of food, in case of
emergency. There is water also. You need not enter
for that. She will pass to you what you require
through the window. Keep guard here for her sake
and for your own, till I return.&quot; Then to Noémi
he said, &quot;Dare you follow me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
&quot;I!&quot; she said, and almost laughed. &quot;Have you
forgotten the stair to the Bishop&#39;s Castle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean stepped off the platform, and walked along
the face of the rock and was immediately followed by
the girl, without the least misgiving or giddiness.</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching the door cut in the crag on the further
side, Jean stepped in.</p>

<p class="indent">These rock chambers are cool in summer and
warm in winter. There was no well here dug in the
heart of the rock. Probably owing to its height above
the level of the Vézère&mdash;some 300 feet&mdash;it had not
been thought likely that a vein of water would be
tapped; so the atmospheric moisture was caught by
little runnels scored in the rock, and all these runnels
led into a receiver, in which there was generally to be
found a supply of water, though not a great quantity.
Each window was provided with shutters, and doors
fitted into the entrances, and could be fastened. Beds
were scooped in the rock, arched above, and these
couches were strewn with heather and fern. In cupboards
cut in the walls were stores, to be used in case
of necessity.</p>

<p class="indent">When Jean had shown the girl everything, he
held out his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi!&quot; he said, and his voice shook, &quot;good-bye!
We may never meet again. But do not think that
harm would be done you by me&mdash;even if the worst
were to happen!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
&quot;Jean!&quot; she answered gravely, and went to the
doorway, and looked down. &quot;Do you think that
anyone who fell here, who tripped coming along these
steps, who stumbled at the threshold, would not be
dashed to pieces in an instant?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sure he would. That is what affords you
protection here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not mean that, Jean.&quot; She refrained from
speaking for a moment. He put out his hand to her,
and she took his. Both their hands trembled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jean, I shall watch for the sunrise from the little
window. If you and your father have not returned&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we shall both perish together in the <i>oubliette</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;and the moment the sun comes up&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi&mdash;what then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The moment I see the first fire-spark&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi!&quot; He feared to hear what she was going
to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Jean, I shall throw myself down&mdash;here.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="center">IN THE DEPTHS.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Before</span> that Jean del&#39; Peyra ventured to cross the
Dordogne and approach Domme, he fastened a white
kerchief to his cap, as token that he came on peaceful
errand, as bearer of a message. As such he was received
within the walls, and was conducted to the
castle, and given admission to the vaulted hall in
which lay Le Gros Guillem on his pallet with his
feet up.</p>

<p class="indent">The long, lean, pale-faced man looked hard at him
when admitted, and said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am Jean del&#39; Peyra,&quot; answered the lad, and
cast his cap with its white appendage on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jean del&#39; Peyra! and you venture here!&quot; roared
the Captain. &quot;You must in verity be a fool!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I came&mdash;trusting to that,&quot; said the youth with
composure, pointing to the white token.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you came trusting in vain. I regard it
not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
&quot;Perhaps you will regard this,&quot; said Jean, extending
the ring, which he plucked from his little
finger.</p>

<p class="indent">The Captain looked at the signet, started, and
brayed forth&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That belongs to Noémi! How came you by
that? You have murdered her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not murdered her. If she dies it will be
through you. She is my captive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Le Gros Guillem slipped his feet from the pallet
to the floor. He could not walk, he could not even
stand, as his feet were swathed in rags.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not difficult to enlighten your understanding,&quot;
said Jean. &quot;You sent away your daughter
with two men as her guard. They are all in my
power. They are at Le Peuch. Their fate&mdash;that is
to say, <i>hers</i>&mdash;depends on you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So&mdash;you war against girls!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If we do violence to the young and feeble, from
whom have we learned the lesson but from you and
your ruffians?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know what I have done to your father,&quot;
said the freebooter, malignantly. &quot;I will do the
same to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the same fate will befall your daughter&mdash;at
once,&quot; said Jean, decidedly.</p>

<p class="indent">The Captain was staggered. He was uneasy. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
said sullenly: &quot;For what purpose have you come
here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For this,&quot; answered Jean. &quot;With your own
hand you have let me know where my father is. Unless
he be released, and allowed to return with me to
Le Peuch, your daughter will perish miserably.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean went to the window. The Captain looked
suspiciously after him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The sun is setting,&quot; said the young man. &quot;In
an hour it will be gone. Unless before he reappears
in the East, unless, to the moment of his rising, my
father and I are not returned to Le Peuch safe and
sound, it will be too late. Your daughter saw what
was done to the old man&mdash;what think you of a like
fate for her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not believe she is in your hands. She is at
La Roque.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Send to La Roque, if you will, and inquire&mdash;only
remember that will take time, and time is precious.
We must be back at Le Peuch before the first
spark of the sun reappears, or the deed will be done.
Your daughter will be dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Le Gros Guillem&#39;s face became ashy grey with
alarm and rage, commingled with embarrassment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Besides,&quot; said Jean with composure, &quot;look at
the ring. You know that it is taken from her finger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Captain turned the ring about in his hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
Then he struck the table with his clenched fist and
screamed&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Outwitted! outwitted again! The devil is fighting
for you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather is he deserting you to whom you sold
yourself,&quot; retorted Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">The chief remained sullen, with knitted brow and
clenched teeth, brooding.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The sun is set,&quot; said Jean, and pointed through
the window.</p>

<p class="indent">The yellow flame had disappeared that had flushed
the hills on the further side of the Dordogne, the
wooded slopes and the tall rock of Vitrac, itself a
natural fortress.</p>

<p class="indent">The Captain moved uneasily on his pallet, and
looked furtively at his guards near the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean read his thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing you can do is of any avail, save the release
of my father. The first ray of sun that lights
the sky sees the spark of life die out in your Noémi&#39;s
heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What guarantee have I that you will not play me
false, and refuse to give her up?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My word, my honour, and that of my father.
Send men with me if you will. Only remember now
that time is winged and is flying.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a horrible oath, Le Gros Guillem again struck
the table and called to the guards. They approached.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
&quot;Take him&quot;&mdash;he indicated Jean&mdash;&quot;take him to
the <i>oubliette</i> chamber,&quot; said he; &quot;let cords down, release
the man, and let both go as they will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He flung Noémi&#39;s ring on the table, and cast his
maimed feet on the pallet once more, and clenched
his teeth and knitted his red brows.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean took up the ring and said: &quot;I will return
this to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The guards now conducted him to the keep.
Lights were provided, also cords; the door into the
cell was opened; and with a shudder Jean entered.</p>

<p class="indent">Snatching a torch from one of the men, he went
to the breastwork of the well, and leaning over it, let
the torch flare down the abyss.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father!&quot; he cried; &quot;my father!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he paused for an answer.</p>

<p class="indent">There was none.</p>

<p class="indent">With the link he endeavoured to illumine the
depths below, but found that this was not possible.
He could see nothing save an awful blackness, in
which the rays of the torch lost themselves, without
illumining any object.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father!&quot; again he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">This time he heard a sound&mdash;an inarticulate
groan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me down. I must go to him,&quot; said Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot take a light with you,&quot; said one of
the men.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
&quot;You can carry one down unlighted, and kindle
it when you are below,&quot; said a second.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean saw that it was as the men said. The orifice
and throat of the well were so narrow that he must
descend without holding a burning light. He nodded,
and slipped his arms through the loops in the cords.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give me a candle,&quot; said he, and one was immediately
handed to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he seated himself on the well-breast, with
his feet hanging down inside; and when the men
were ready, thrust himself off.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean was lowered gradually down the bottle-throat,
till all at once the sides fell away, and he was swinging
in space.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The effect of being suddenly plunged
in absolute blackness of darkness is not so startling as
some might suppose. The retina of the eye carries
with it an impression of light; and as Jean was let
down through void space of absolutely rayless gloom,
it seemed to him as though a rosy halo attended
him; he could, indeed, discern nothing&mdash;no object
whatever&mdash;but he could not suppose that he did not.
All at once his feet touched ground. Then he released
his arms, and struck a light with steel and flint.
Some time elapsed before the tinder kindled, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
from the tinder he was able to ignite the candle.
Jean&#39;s hand shook. He was nervous lest he should
see his father dead or dying. It seemed inexplicable
to him that he was not answered readily when he
called. Finally, the yellow flame flickered. Then
the lad raised the candle above his head and looked
about him. He was in a dungeon some thirteen feet
square, built of hewn stones in large blocks, laid together
with the finest joints, that did not show mortar.
The sides were perfectly smooth. The chamber
was arched overhead; there was in it no door,
no window, no hole of any sort save that in the
midst of the vault overhead, through which he had
descended.</p>

The description of the interior of the <i>oubliette</i> is in accordance
with that into which the author was lowered at Castelnau
le Bretenoux. The ruin of the castle at Domme is so complete
that the <i>oubliettes</i> there, if they existed, are buried.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Against the wall, lying with his head raised, his
eyes open, looking at the light, not at Jean, was his
father, his legs extended on the cold floor, and about
him were strewn the bones of dead men, skulls and
skeletons, more or less disturbed by the blind groping
of the last victim.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean at once went to the old man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father! dear father!&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is I&mdash;Jean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have come to release you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old man&#39;s senses seemed lost.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
Jean at once knelt, and drawing a phial from his
breast, poured into Ogier&#39;s mouth a spirit distilled
from the juniper berries that grow on the Causse.</p>

<p class="indent">His father drew a deep inspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a long night, and a bad dream,&quot; he said.
&quot;Where are the tansy and the butterfly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father, no time is to be lost. Can you rise?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old man scrambled to his feet. He was as
one in a trance. Jean led him to the cords, and
thrust his father&#39;s arms through the loops.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mind and hold your hands down,&quot; he said.
&quot;Father, you will see the light of day! the light of
day! Be quick! you will see it before it is gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The light&mdash;the sun?&quot; asked Ogier, eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The sun is set, father; but you will see the
evening sky and the stars.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The light! O my God! the light, do you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Draw him up!&quot; ordered Jean, and watched with
great anxiety as the ropes were strained and the old
Seigneur&#39;s feet left the ground. Then Ogier was carried
up, and passed with head, then shoulders through
the orifice in the vault.</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed to Jean as though half an hour elapsed
before the ropes descended again. When he saw them
fall, then he eagerly blew out the candle, and committed
himself to the cords. In three minutes he
was above ground. He saw his father standing in the
doorway, looking out over the terrace at the clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
evening sky, drawing in long breaths of the sweet
pure air of evening into his lungs.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean turned to the two men.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thank you,&quot; he said. &quot;Here is gold. If I can
do aught to repay you, in the many troubles and
changes of affairs that occur, it shall be done. Your
name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am Peyrot le Fort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I, Heliot Prebost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Enough! I shall not forget. We must away.
Lead me once more to the Captain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean took his father under the arm. The old
man walked along with tolerable steadiness, but said
nothing. He was as one stupefied. He did not seem
to realise that he had been released, but to be labouring
under uncertainty whether he were dreaming that
he was at liberty or not, and was oppressed with the
dread of waking to find himself in the abyss.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean and his father were introduced into the hall
where lay Le Gros Guillem. The Captain had not
allowed lights to be introduced, as his eyes were
somewhat inflamed by the irritation which pervaded
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Captain,&quot; said Jean. &quot;You must remember that
this is not all. The day is spent. We must travel
all night, and I have a horse awaiting my father. But
you have despoiled him of his coat. He cannot leave
in his shirt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
&quot;I have not his coat,&quot; said Guillem, roughly. &quot;I
restore the man, that suffices.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does not suffice. Give him back his jerkin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The executioner&mdash;the jailer has it. It is his perquisite.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot go after him. Send for it yourself.
Consider what you are apt to forget, that time is all-important.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here!&quot; ordered the Captain. &quot;Bring the old fellow
one of mine&mdash;any worn one will suffice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later a leather coat was given to Jean,
brought by a serving-man. It was dark in the hall.
Le Gros Guillem did not concern himself to look at
what was produced. Probably the serving-man himself
had taken the garment in a hurry without regarding
it.</p>

<p class="indent">As Jean threw the jerkin over his father&#39;s shoulders,
he felt that it was lined throughout with metal
rings, and was impervious to a sword-blow or a pike-thrust.</p>

<p class="indent">As Ogier, invested in this garment, prepared to depart,
the Captain, with brutal insolence, shouted&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seigneur! was it cold and black below?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old man did not reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We two have met thrice,&quot; pursued Le Gros Guillem.
&quot;Once I fell on you at Ste. Soure and made <i>you</i>
run,&quot; he laughed harshly; &quot;secondly, you fell on me
unawares, and <i>I</i> came off the worst. The third time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
we met on the Beune. It might be esteemed a drawn
battle, but as I had captured you, I had got what I
wanted. However, I have been over-reached; I am
outwitted once more this time. Take care how we
encounter for the fourth time. Do you mark me,
Ogier del&#39; Peyra? The fourth time&mdash;that will be the
fatal meeting for one or other of us. The fourth time,
Ogier.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fourth time. I shall remember,&quot; said the
old man dreamily, and touched his forehead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lead him away. Peyrot and Heliot, you shall
ride with the Sieur and his son to Le Peuch. Stay a
moment! a word before you go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He waited till Del&#39; Peyra and his son had left the
hall and were descending to the courtyard. Then he
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Attend them till you are at Le Peuch, get my
daughter safely into your hands, and then cut them
down&mdash;these cursed Del&#39; Peyras&mdash;and bring me their
heads at your saddle-bows. You shall be paid what
you choose to ask.&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="center">A NIGHT RIDE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Jean del&#39; Peyra with his father and escort
arrived at the point opposite the house of the ferryman
on the Dordogne he shouted for the boat.</p>

<p class="indent">Night had set in, but the moon would rise in an
hour; in the meanwhile some light lingered over the
sunken sun, and the stars were shining faintly.</p>

<p class="indent">The river gliding on in rapid descent, but without
rush and coil, reflected the light above. It was as
though a heaven of sparks seen through tears lay at
the feet of Jean as he stood and waited in vain for
the ferry.</p>

<p class="indent">He was vexed at the delay. Time was speeding
along. His father&#39;s condition made him uneasy.
The old man was singularly reticent and stolid; he
expressed no satisfaction at his release.</p>

<p class="indent">After waiting and renewing his shouts to no purpose,
one of the men said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is a wedding in this ferryman&#39;s wife&#39;s family.
I have a notion that he may have gone to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
merrymaking. It is not often that there are passengers
at night that need his punting-pole.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must try the ford,&quot; said the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is that?&quot; asked Jean, impatiently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Further down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then lead to it immediately. We have already
squandered too much valuable time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The party now descended the river-bank till the
spot was reached where the Dordogne could be traversed
without danger by the horsemen.</p>

<p class="indent">The beasts went in. There had not been much
rain of late, consequently the ford was passable. The
water, however, surged up the leg when the horses had
entered to their girths.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, all at once, Ogier del&#39; Peyra laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, father?&quot; asked Jean, startled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not a vision. I am not asleep!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old man had been oppressed with fear, lest
what he went through was a phantasm of the brain,
and lest he should wake to the hideous reality of a living
entombment. The swash of the cold water over
his foot, up his calf, above his knee, was the first thing
that roused him to the certainty that he was really free.</p>

<p class="indent">Without difficulty and danger the little party
crossed the river; they ascended the flanks of the
great plateau and passed at once into oak woods.
Thence, after a while, they emerged upon a bald track,
where there was hardly any soil at all, and the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
region seemed to be struck with perpetual hoar-frost.
The hoe, even the foot turned up chalk-flakes. Nothing
could grow on so barren a surface.</p>

<p class="indent">The moon rose and made the waste look colder,
deader than under the starlight.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly shouts were heard, and at the same moment
before the little party rushed an old grey wolf.
As he passed he turned to them with a snarl that
showed his fangs gleaming as ivory in the moonlight.
He did not stop&mdash;he fled precipitately; and next moment
from out of a dell rushed a troop of men armed
with pikes, pitchforks, and cudgels, attended by a legion
of farm-dogs yelping vigorously.</p>

<p class="indent">The little party drew up. The moon gleamed on
the morions and the steel plates sewn on the buff jerkins,
and black to westward on the white causse<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> lay
the shadows of horses and men.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_8_8">
<span class="label">[8]</span></a>
The Causse, from Calx, is the chalk or limestone plateau.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">A portion of those pursuing the wolf halted.
&quot;Haro! Haro!&quot; shouted one man. &quot;Here are human
wolves, the worst of all! Let us kill them before
we run the other down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the clear moonlight they had seen the crosses of
the <i>routiers</i> on the arms of the two men sent from
Domme. In a moment the party was surrounded, and
the two freebooters to protect themselves drew their
swords.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
Jean pushed forward. &quot;My friends, do you not
know me? We are the Del&#39; Peyras, and my father is
but just released from bondage. I am taking him
home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will not hurt you, Messire Jean,&quot; said a peasant.
&quot;But these fellows with you&mdash;they are beasts of
prey. They have killed our men. Stand aside, that
we may knock them off their horses and then beat out
their brains.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shall not do this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not? They are brigands, and not fit to
live.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are under my protection.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The peasants were ill satisfied; having felt their
power they had become impatient of all restraint
on it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here,&quot; said Jean, &quot;my honour and my
father&#39;s are engaged for these men. Do not force us
to draw our swords on their behalf.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you know but that they will fall on
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They dare not,&quot; answered Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would trust a wolf rather than one of these.
Come on!&quot; The last address was to his fellows.</p>

<p class="indent">Then those who had halted turned and ran in the
track of such as were pursuing the wolf.</p>

<p class="indent">What Jean del&#39; Peyra had said was true enough.
The two men attending him would not dare to commit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
an act of treachery on the way to Ste. Soure. He
and his father were safe till Noémi was restored.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean spoke to his father. The old man was silent
as he rode; now he roused himself as from a trance
to answer Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you say, my son?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father, we must push on at a quicker pace.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot push on&mdash;I want to go to sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To sleep, father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am falling from my horse with fatigue. I
must get off. I must lie down. I have not had my
proper rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean was dismayed; time was slipping along, the
moon describing her arch in heaven; he must reach
Le Peuch before daybreak, and now his father asked
for a halt. It was true that he had allowed time for
resting the horses on the way, but how long would
the old man require for his repose? The strain on
his nerves, the horror of the darkness and expectation
of a lingering death in the vault, had been so great
that a reaction had set in, and he was unable to keep
his eyes open.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father,&quot; said the young man, &quot;you cannot tarry
here on the open <i>causse</i>, we must get on, into the coppice,
to a charcoal-burner&#39;s lodge. There is one at no
great distance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A few minutes later Jean looked at his father.
The old man had let fall his bridle, his head was sunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
on his breast; in another moment he would have
dropped from his saddle.</p>

<p class="indent">The youth called to him, and Ogier started and
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am coming&mdash;directly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In another second he was again asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">It was needful to dismount and make Ogier walk.
So alone could he be kept awake. Half a mile distant
was the charcoal-burner&#39;s heap, and a rude cabin of
branches beside it.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the <i>routiers</i> led Ogier&#39;s horse. The old
man became angry and irritable at being forced to
walk. He scolded his son, he complained that he was
badly treated; in vain did Jean explain that he desired
him to go on but a little way. The Seigneur
stood still, and said he must sit down&mdash;he could not,
he would not proceed.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Jean poured the rest of his flask of spirit
down Ogier&#39;s throat, and said peremptorily, &quot;You
shall come on, whether you will or no.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old Seigneur obeyed, grumbled, and in a few
minutes was at the charcoal-burning station, and had
flung himself on a bed of fern in the hut, and was
asleep almost as soon as he had cast himself on the
bracken.</p>

<p class="indent">The charcoal-burner recognised Jean del&#39; Peyra
and saluted him respectfully, but looked askance at
the two <i>routiers</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
&quot;Have you seen or heard anything of the hunt?&quot;
asked the collier. &quot;My mate has gone with the rest
after the wolf. You see that grey beast has already
carried off three children. Yesterday it was Mascot&#39;s
babe&mdash;and now all the country is up; and they are
going to run the wolf down. There is a ring formed
round the <i>causse.</i>They lured him with a dead sheep.
It is to be trusted they will kill him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean said a word or two in reply. He was very
uneasy. The heaviness with which his father slept
showed him that he was in no condition to be roused
at the end of the hour and made to remount. Ogier&#39;s
strength was exhausted, and this was not to be wondered
at, considering what he had gone through.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean spoke to the collier, and explained to him
that he proposed letting the old man remain where he
was and sleep his full. He himself must ride on with
his companions, and he would return in the morning
for his father.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile the <i>routiers</i> had drawn aside and were
conversing in a low tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What say you, Heliot? The old fellow will not
ride on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then one of us must stay, Peyrot,&quot; answered the
other, &quot;and the other proceed with the young one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not finish them at once?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You fool! We cannot&mdash;we must recover the
demoiselle first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
&quot;That is true&mdash;I will stay&mdash;you ride forward.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is one to me which I dispatch,&quot; said Heliot.
&quot;You can remain, Peyrot, and it is well for us that
the Seigneur has broken down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because we should have found it difficult to lay
hands on them at Ste. Soure or at Le Peuch, among
their own people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There will be Amanieu and Roger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;Amanieu and Roger; but all depends&mdash;if
there be only women about the thing will be easy
enough, but if men be there in arms, I do not see how
we could do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But now&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly&mdash;now all is coming smooth to our
hands,&quot; said Heliot. &quot;For the young Seigneur must
return hither to fetch his father&mdash;and on the Causse,
here among the coppice, away from all habitations, we
can dispatch them easily.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will kill the old man at once&mdash;as soon as you
have ridden on,&quot; said Peyrot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As you like&mdash;but you cannot reckon on the
collier. He is a big man. If you kill him first, well
and good; but if he be on the alert, and you note how
suspiciously he looks at us, then he may escape and run
and give the alarm, so my sword will be prevented
taking the fresher blood of the young Del&#39; Peyra.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then what would you have me do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
&quot;Remain here. Disarm the suspicions of the
charcoal-burner. Keep near the Seigneur, especially
in the morning. If he be awake, be at his side; if
asleep, watch by his bed. The collier must attend to
his charcoal. When I draw near with the demoiselle
and Amanieu and Roger, and the young man, then
cut him down and take his head. I will do the same
to the youth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the voice of Jean was heard summoning
them to mount. His impatience would not endure a
longer delay.</p>

<p class="indent">Peyrot le Fort came up and said: &quot;I am not
going further.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not coming on? You must.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot; my horse is lame.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lame! I did not observe that as we rode along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had no eyes save for your father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If lame, of course you must stay. We cannot&mdash;we
dare not linger here longer. Tarry with my father
till we return.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Jean went into the booth of the charcoal-burner
and looked at his sleeping father. Within
was dark, and accidentally he touched the old man&#39;s
foot. At once Ogier started into a sitting posture,
and cried out, &quot;Yes, yes, Guillem! The fourth time&mdash;I
shall not forget!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he threw himself back, and was sound asleep
again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="center">THE RING.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Noémi</span> could not sleep that night. She sat in
her rocky prison looking out over the valley of the
Vézère at the distant landscape bathed in glorious
moonlight. Opposite Le Peuch the rocks are not
precipitous; there is a falling away of the plateau
into soft undulations and stages, rounded in the wood
and sombre in their mantle of trees.</p>

<p class="indent">The moon was full&mdash;so bright that it eclipsed
every star save its attendant Venus; the whole sky
was infused with light, the darkness of the deep blue
turned to grey. The Vézère gleamed as a plate of
molten silver below.</p>

<p class="indent">The river passed with a sigh rather than a murmur.
How white, dazzling white, those cliffs must
seem facing the moon, standing up like gigantic
horse-teeth! The moon smote in at the window
where sat Noémi. It bathed her face, her arm that
was raised to sustain her chin.</p>

<p class="indent">How glorious was the world! how peaceful! how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
happy! Only man, with his lust of rapine, his love
of violence, transformed it into a place of torment.
What if there were no parties&mdash;one English, the other
French&mdash;but all this fair land reposed under a single
sceptre! And what if that one sceptre controlled
evildoers, put down lawlessness, and, extended over
the land, bid it rest! What if all evildoers were
rooted out, and first among these Le Gros Guillem!</p>

<p class="indent">Below in Ste. Soure was the sound of a human
voice, of a woman singing to her child that wept and
would not sleep. Noémi could not hear the words,
but she knew the air, and with her lips murmured&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">B&#39;aqui la luno</span>
<span class="i0">Sé y&#39;n abio dios, t&#39;en dounarioy uno!</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Moon, moon! gloriously bright! If there were two
I would give thee one! I would give thee one&mdash;thee!
thee!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To whom would she give the moon if there were
two, and one were at her disposal? The mother
would give it to her babe because her whole heart was
for that child. And she&mdash;Noémi&mdash;to whom would
she give the moon&mdash;to whom?</p>

<p class="indent">Was she not going to give something better than
the moon&mdash;even her precious life?</p>

<p class="indent">Yes; not for a moment did she waver in her
resolution. If Jean del&#39; Peyra did not return on
the morrow by first sun-peep she would cast herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
down&mdash;and what matter? Would life be worth a
rush to her when she knew that Jean was dead?
Dead he would be, if he did not return&mdash;dead, along
with his father&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">B&#39;aqui lo vito!</span>
<span class="i0">Sé y&#39;n abio dios, t&#39;en dounarioy lu doui!</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Life! life! precious life! If I had two I would give
thee both!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The night passed slowly, and still Noémi sat at
the opening in the rock. The moon had mounted
high in heaven and sailed down the western sky. It
no longer peered into the rock-chamber, no longer
flooded her form as she sat motionless at the
opening.</p>

<p class="indent">Her brain had no rest. Thoughts turned and
twisted in her head. Again and ever again she asked
whether for her sake her father would yield up his
prey&mdash;sacrifice the opportunity offered him of putting
his foot down at once on and crushing the Del&#39; Peyra
family in the persons of father and son together. She
knew the implacability of his temper, the ruthlessness
with which when offended he pursued his revenge to
the end. Dear she might be to him, but was she
dearer than vengeance on such as had humiliated him
as he had never been humiliated before? The air
became raw and chill, with that rawness and chill
which precede dawn.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
Noémi rose and went to the door and looked across
the chasm to the guard-room, which, it will be remembered,
was an excavation in a rocky buttress. Holding
the jambs she looked and listened. She could
hear no sound. Amanieu and Roger were asleep.
They had not been disturbed during the day, and in
confidence that no danger menaced, they had cast
themselves on the bed and slept. Still holding the
jambs, she leaned forward and looked down. Below
all was dark. The moon was behind the hill, and its
shadow lay black along the slope. There was so
much light in the sky that she was able to distinguish
in the depths masses of white rock, lying about faintly
discernible like high up vaporous white cloud in a
summer sky&mdash;rocks there on which her head would
dash and her limbs be broken within a few hours, unless
Jean and his father appeared&mdash;white rocks there
that would be splashed with her blood. If Le Gros
Guillem would not yield up his victims this would be
the end of her young life. To him she would, she
could not return. Her honour&mdash;her word was engaged&mdash;here
she would perish.</p>

<p class="indent">The night was chill, she drew a mantle about her,
and resting her head against the stone jamb of the
window, looked out dreamily&mdash;and slipped into unconsciousness,
to start to full life and activity of
thought at a sound, the whistle of Roger or Amanieu
in the guard-room rock.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
These men were awake. Day was broken. In the
east the sky was white.</p>

<p class="indent">The church-bell began to toll for Mass. From her
window she could see the village. The hills opposite
were black, hard as cast-iron against the whitening
sky. A halo already stood over the place where the
sun would mount, and a cloud high up was shot with
gold. Noémi was shivering with cold. She rose and
paced the chamber, but ever and anon returned to the
window to look out. The white light was changing
to amber, the sun was at hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Roger was carolling merrily, and smoke issued
from the guard-chamber. The men were lighting a
fire whereat to warm themselves, and perhaps do some
cooking for their morning meal. In the cold meadow
by the water-side, where lay a whiteness like a snow, a
peasant was visible, turning the glebe with his plough
fastened to the horns of a pair of oxen.</p>

<p class="indent">She paced her chamber faster. She could not
overcome the shivering that pervaded her. The cold
had entered the marrow of her bones, and with it her
heart turned sick. Where was Jean? Was he in the
oubliette? Had he been cast down on the body of
his dying father?</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Noémi stood still. Painted on the rock
opposite the window was a saffron spot of light. The
sun was risen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is all over!&quot; she said, and went to the door.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
There she uttered a cry&mdash;a cry of joy and release.</p>

<p class="indent">Along the surface of the rock ran Jean towards
her. He leaped on the threshold, and she caught and
drew him in with both hands.</p>

<p class="indent">The chill had gone from her. A rush of glowing
life swept through her arteries and suffused her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Saved!&quot; she gasped. &quot;Oh, Jean, is it well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am but just in time!&quot; he answered. &quot;All is
well. I came on&mdash;my father is behind, too tired to
proceed at my pace. Oh, Noémi, Noémi&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They held hands, they could neither speak more
words. Her eyes filled with tears, and then she
sobbed.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean was moved. &quot;Noémi,&quot; he said, &quot;I shall
never, never forget what you have done for us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl speedily recovered herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must back to Domme,&quot; she said. &quot;My task
is done. You did not say that I had surrendered
myself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I let Le Gros Guillem think that we had
captured you. But it is with me as with you. I
must be back to my father. There is a fellow come
with me&mdash;called Heliot, and with my father is Peyrot
le Fort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The worst&mdash;the most treacherous ruffians there
are!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They can do no hurt. At all events, till you are
restored.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
&quot;From that moment their hands are free.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean became grave for a moment. But his was an
honest nature, not prone to mistrust, even in the
midst of the lawlessness and falsehood of the times.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, bah!&quot; said he. &quot;I can defend myself!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then let us start immediately,&quot; said Noémi.
&quot;I would that you had not to come back with me.
I would your father had not been left with Peyrot le
Fort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean went into his father&#39;s castle. He ordered
two men-at-arms to attend him. Roger and Amanieu
were as well to accompany the Captain&#39;s daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">In less than an hour all were ready to start. A
breakfast was hastily snatched, and Jean&#39;s horse, as
well as that of the <i>routier</i>, was given water and
corn.</p>

<p class="indent">The band of men that left Ste. Soure consisted
now of Jean del&#39; Peyra, with his two men mounted,
also of Noémi, attended by three of her father&#39;s <i>routiers</i>.
The men whom Jean had taken with him as
attendants were not accustomed to riding; they could
handle a pike, but had not been called to service on
horseback, and this became speedily evident, for on
descending a hill which was rough with chalk nodules
and flints, one of them let his horse fall, and himself
rolled some way down. The beast was injured and
the man bruised. To Jean&#39;s annoyance he was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
only detained, but obliged to leave the fellow behind.
He was engaged for some minutes examining the
horse&#39;s knees and satisfying himself that the brute
was not in a condition to go further.</p>

<p class="indent">When he rejoined Noémi she said to him in a low
tone&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let the men ride on; I have a word to say to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jean slackened pace and waited till a sufficient
distance separated them from their attendants. Then
she said: &quot;Treachery is intended. Heliot has been
working Amanieu and Roger. Amanieu says he will
do nothing; observe him now. He has thrust his
hands into his belt; that means that he will neither
serve Le Gros Guillem nor Del&#39; Peyra, but let the
others do as they list. As for Roger, he has pretended
to agree, and he has cautioned me. He does
not know particulars. Heliot would not trust him&mdash;he
only sounded Roger.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The fellow shall at once be disarmed,&quot; said Jean,
and rode forward. The routier was summoned to deliver
up his sword, and seeing that he could obtain no
assistance from his former comrades, sullenly surrendered.
He was then allowed to ride on with the rest,
but with his hands bound.</p>

<p class="indent">In the meanwhile the other routier had been spending
the remainder of the night by the charcoal-burner&#39;s
pile. He found the peasant churlish and indisposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
for conversation, wary, and watchful of all
his movements. Now and again, when the collier was
engaged on his heap, Peyrot stole into the hut to look
at the sleeping Seigneur, but immediately was followed
by the burner with his pronged fork.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you always run after me?&quot; he asked
churlishly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I know that such as you purpose no
good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the morning the old Seigneur awoke, and
came forth. He said nothing, but as he looked at the
collier, who was eating brown bread, the man concluded
he was hungry, and readily shared his breakfast
with him, but absolutely refused to break bread
with the rover. Peyrot was hungry, and irritated because
he was not given the opportunity of executing
his intention. He would have attacked the collier
but that he feared him; the man was tall, muscular,
and on the alert. His black face disguised his feelings,
but his eyes flashed with a saturnine light at
every suspicious movement of the man-at-arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They come! they come!&quot; shouted the charcoal-burner,
starting forward.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They come!&quot; echoed Peyrot, and at once he had
his sword out, and had struck at Ogier from behind.
The blow would have been fatal had not the old man
worn Le Gros Guillem&#39;s jerkin lined with ring mail.
In a moment Peyrot was caught by the fork of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
collier, round the throat, under chin and ears, was
flung backwards and pinned to the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haro! help all! I have the wolf!&quot; yelled the
man, and from out of the scrub poured the peasants
returning from the chase.</p>

<p class="indent">They had been so far successful that they had
killed the male wolf and the cubs, but the dam had
escaped them. They were exultant, excited by the
hunt; they carried the beasts they had killed slung
across poles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See here!&quot; cried the collier. &quot;Here is the worst
wolf of all&mdash;he tried to murder the Sieur del&#39;
Peyra!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will drive him into your charcoal and burn
him!&quot; cried a peasant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will spoil my charcoal. He is not worth
it,&quot; answered the collier.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will hack him to pieces!&quot; &quot;We will cudgel
out his brains!&quot; &quot;We will flay him alive!&quot; As
many voices, so many opinions.</p>

<p class="indent">At the same time arrived the party from Le
Peuch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here are others! See! Another red cross!
Burn&mdash;hang&mdash;brain them both! Here are other two!
Kill them all&mdash;all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The peasants seethed and swirled round Heliot,
whose hands were bound, and about Amanieu and
Roger.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
&quot;My friends,&quot; said Jean del&#39; Peyra, &quot;you are mistaken.
This is my prisoner. The others are my very
good friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You would not let us kill them before, and now
this fellow tried to murder your father. He struck
at him from behind like a coward.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he has done that,&quot; said Jean, &quot;his life is forfeit.
Who says he did that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do,&quot; answered the collier. &quot;I saw him. He
has been looking out for an opportunity all morning.
I saved the Seigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well,&quot; said Jean. &quot;Then I speak no word
in his behalf. Let him be taken to the next tree and
hanged.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hang him! hang him! who has a rope? That
which fastens the old wolf will do! No&mdash;it is too
short, make a band of hazel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then a voice shouted: &quot;There is before you Le
Gros Guillem&#39;s daughter. Why should we kill the
wolf&#39;s cubs and let run Guillem&#39;s whelps?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kill her! kill the whelp!&quot; yelled the men, and
crowded round Noémi.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is a Tarde! Hands off!&quot; called another.
&quot;Take the men, do not touch a woman!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the crowd precipitated itself on the bound
<i>routier</i>; Amanieu and Roger drew their swords and
kept the peasants at bay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is a cub of Gros Guillem, I swear it!&quot; called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
a man. &quot;Kill the whole breed, or she will mother
<i>loups-garoug</i>!&quot; (Were-wolves.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Messire Jean! we have no cause against you,&quot;
said an immense man, a farmer, coming up and laying
hold of Jean&#39;s horse&#39;s bridle. &quot;But we will not spare
any of that Domme race. They are accursed&mdash;have
they not been excommunicated by the Pope&mdash;by the
Bishop? We do not spare a wolf-cub however piteously
it whine, however young it be, to whatever sex it
may belong; and if this be a cub of the were-wolf
Guillem, shall we be squeamish? Swear to us she is
not of the race, and she shall pass untouched. If not,
we will kill her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Densely packed round him, brandishing forks and
clubs and axes were the men, rendered savage by oppression,
and now reckless by success. None were the
retainers of the Del&#39; Peyras. Jean knew not to what
master they belonged. The men roared&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Swear she is not Guillem&#39;s daughter, or we will
kill her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The moment was one of supreme danger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi!&quot; said he hastily. &quot;Hold out thy hand!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She obeyed, extending her fingers straight before
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Swear! swear!&quot; yelled the men.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Jean plucked open his purse, drew out the
ring she had sent by him to her father, and said, as
he held it aloft&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&quot;See all; I put it on her finger. Do you want to
know who she is? Know all that she is the betrothed
of Jean del&#39; Peyra, son of the Sieur del Peuch de Ste.
Soure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A shriek&mdash;a shriek of horror and agony.</p>

<p class="indent">The attention of those crowding in on Noémi and
Jean was diverted.</p>

<p class="indent">Some men had taken up Peyrot le Fort, and had
rammed him with their pitchforks into the fuming
pyre of the charcoal-burner, then had massed on sods
and clay, and had beat it down over him with their
spades.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ride! away! ride!&quot; shouted Jean.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="center">A DISAPPEARANCE.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> old Seigneur del&#39; Peyra was not exactly a
changed man since his descent into and release from
the oubliette; he was rather the man he had been of
old with his dullness, inertness intensified. He spoke
very little, never referred to his adventures&mdash;it might
almost be thought that he had forgotten them, but
that on the smallest allusion to Le Gros Guillem his
eye would fire, all the muscles of his face quiver, and
he would abruptly leave the society of such as spoke
of the man who had so ill-treated him.</p>

<p class="indent">Except for the sudden agitations into which he
was thrown by such allusions, he was almost torpid.
He took no interest in his land, in his people, in his
castle. He sat much on a stone in the sun when the
sun shone, looking at the ground before him. When
the cold and rainy weather set in, then he sat in the
fire-corner with his eyes riveted on the flames. One
thing he could not endure, and that was darkness.
The coming on of night filled him with unrest. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
could not abide in a room where did not burn a light.
He would start from sleep during the night several
times to make sure that the lamp was still burning.</p>

<p class="indent">At first Jean had spoken to his father relative to
the incidents of his capture, and had asked him particulars
about his treatment, but desisted from doing
so as he saw how profoundly it affected the old man,
and how slow he was of recovering his equanimity after
such an attempt to extract his recollections from
him. Nor could he consult him about the affairs of
the Seigneurie. The old man seemed incapable of
fixing his mind on any such matters. Not that his
brain had ceased to act, but that it was preoccupied
with one absorbing idea, from which it resented diversion.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean made an attempt to sound his father&#39;s
thoughts, but in vain, and he satisfied himself that
the only course open to him was to leave the old man
alone, and to trust to the restorative forces of Nature
to recover him. He had received a shock which had
shaken his powers but had not destroyed them. If
left alone he would in time be himself again.</p>

<p class="indent">There was much to occupy the mind and take up
the time of Jean del&#39; Peyra.</p>

<p class="indent">The winter had set in. The leaves had been shed
from the trees. There had set in a week of rain, and
the river Vézère had swelled to a flood red-brown in
colour, sweeping away the soil rich in phosphates that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
overlay the chalk, and which alone sustained vegetation.
If the Vézère were in flood, so also was the
Dordogne, and both rivers being impassable, the little
Seigneurie of Le Peuch Ste. Soure was safe. It
was divided from its foe at Domme by these swollen
dykes.</p>

<p class="indent">But floods would subside in time, the weather
would clear, and although it was not probable that
Le Gros Guillem would attempt reprisals during the
winter, yet it would be injudicious not to maintain
watch and be prepared against an attack.</p>

<p class="indent">The peasant, impulsive and inconsiderate, was not
to be trusted without direction, and required to be
watched so as to be kept to the ungrateful task of
semi-military service. He was easily stirred to acts of
furious violence, and as easily allowed himself to lapse
into blind security. Having taken and destroyed
l&#39;Eglise and beaten back the <i>routiers</i> on the Beune,
the peasants considered that they had done all that
could be required of them; they hastily reconverted
their swords into the ploughshares that they
had been, and dismounted their spears to employ
them for their proper use as pruning-hooks. At the
same time that they thus turned their implements of
husbandry to peaceful ends, so did they dismantle
themselves of all military ambition, and revert to the
condition of the boor, whose thoughts are in the soil
he turns and returns, whose produce he reaps and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
mows. The peasant mind is not flexible, and it is
very limited in its range. It can think of but one
thing at a time, and it is wholly void of that nimbleness
which is acquired by association with men of
many avocations and of intellectual culture. For a
moment, stirred by intolerable wrongs, his passions
had flared into an all-consuming flame. Now he was
again the plodding ploughman, happy to handle the
muckfork and the goad.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean found it impossible to rouse the men to
understand the necessity of being ever on the alert
against the foe. Gros Guillem, said they, had pillaged
Ste. Soure; he had done his worst; now he
would go and plunder elsewhere. He had tried conclusions
with them and had been worsted; in future
he would test his strength against weaker men.
<i>Allons!</i> we have had enough of fighting&mdash;there is
much to be done on the farm. Jean del&#39; Peyra foresaw
danger, and would not relax his efforts to be prepared
to meet it. He established sentinels to keep
watch night and day, and he marshalled the peasants
and drilled them. They grumbled, and endeavoured
to shirk, and he had hard matter to enforce discipline.
He received tidings from Domme, and ascertained
that the feet of the Captain were completely
restored; and that he was about the town and citadel
as usual.</p>

<p class="indent">He had matter to occupy him and divert his attention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
from Le Peuch. For some time the great stress
of war between the French and the English had been
in the north; there the Maid of Orleans had led to
victory, and there she had been basely deserted and
allowed to fall into the hands of the English. No
sooner, however, had these latter burnt &quot;the sorceress&quot;
than they turned their attention to Guyenne.
There matters had not been favourable to the three
Leopards. Bergerac, on the Dordogne, an important
mercantile centre devoted to the French cause, and
which had been long held by the English, had been
freed, and had the Lilies waving from its citadel.
Then suddenly the English forces from Bordeaux
had appeared under the walls, and the garrison, unable
to defend itself unassisted, had fled, and once
more the Lilies were thrown down and the Leopards
unfurled. But recently, owing to some outrage committed
in the town by some of the soldiers of the castle,
the whole of the inhabitants had risen in a mass,
had surprised the garrison, and had butchered them
to a man. Bergerac was again French. For the last
time it had borne the English yoke. During three
hundred years, with the exception of a few intervals,
it had been under English dominion (1150-1450),
many a time had French and English fought under
its walls for the possession of such a strong point,
which by its position commanded the course of the
Dordogne. Tradition even says that in one day the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
town passed thrice into English and thrice into French
hands.</p>

<p class="indent">The recovery of Bergerac by the Count of Penthièvre,
the Lieutenant of the King of France in
Guyenne, and the treatment of the garrison by the
citizens, alarmed Le Gros Guillem. He was keenly
alive to the disaffection of the town of Domme. He
was in a less satisfactory position than the commandant
of Bergerac. For this latter place was surrounded
by strongholds of barons attached to the
English cause, not on principle, but for their own
interest; the nearest town up the river, Le Linde,
was a <i>bastide</i> in English hands. The heights bristled
with castles, all held by men strongly opposed to the
crown of France, all ready to harass in every way the
citizens who had dared to free themselves. The situation
at Domme was other. Nearly in face of it was
a town almost as important in population, quite as
securely defended by Nature, and dominated by a castle
of exceptional inexpugnability. The Governor of
this place was the brother of the Bishop of Sarlat,
and could not be bribed to betray his charge. From
his eyrie every movement of Guillem was watched. La
Roque was a stronghold with the whole county of Sarlat
at its back, and thence it could be filled with men unseen
from Domme, to organise a sudden attack on the
enemy&#39;s position. That alone might be repelled, but
that aided by treachery within the walls might succeed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
Consequently Guillem was engaged in filling his
ranks and accumulating material of war. Desire as
he might, and did, to chastise those at Ste. Soure, he
could not do so at the moment.</p>

<p class="indent">Never did he ride by La Roque without casting on
it a covetous gaze. It was the key to the whole of the
Black Périgord&mdash;the county of Sarlat.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean del&#39; Peyra&#39;s mind reverted often to Noémi.
He had not seen her since that incident of the ring.
Then, attended by Amanieu and Roger, she had ridden
away at full gallop and had escaped. At the
same time he had succeeded in cutting the bands that
held the arms of Heliot, and had suffered him to ride
away as well. Jean was naturally adverse to deeds
of bloodshed; and though the fellow justly merited
death, he had no desire that the peasantry should constitute
themselves at once accusers, judges, and executioners.
Jean thought repeatedly of that strange
scene&mdash;his engagement by ring to Noémi, forced on
him to save her from the violence of the angry peasants&mdash;the
only means available to him at the moment
for evading the question as to her parentage.</p>

<p class="indent">But though he had quickly proclaimed her to be
his affianced bride, he did not seriously purpose to
make her his. Though he loved her, though his
heart eagerly recognised her generosity of feeling,
the real goodness that was in her, he could not forget
to what stock she belonged. It would not be possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
for him to consider her as one who would be
his&mdash;when he was at deadly enmity with the father.
It would not be decent, natural, to take to his side
the child of the ruffian who had treated his own
father in a manner of refined barbarity. It was
known throughout the country what Guillem had
done&mdash;and the whole country would point the finger
of scorn at him if he so condoned the outrage as to
marry the daughter of the perpetrator of it. But,
more than that, he was certain to be engaged in
hand-to-hand fight with Guillem. He did not for
a moment doubt that this man would seize the first
opportunity of attacking and probably of overwhelming
him with numbers. When next they met the
meeting would be final, and fatal to one or the other.
Either he or Le Gros Guillem would issue from the
struggle with his hands wet with the blood of the
other. It mattered not which turn matters took,
what the result was&mdash;either precluded union with
Noémi.</p>

<p class="indent">He would have liked to have seen her, to have
parted from her with words of gratitude for what she
had done for him and his father. He would have
liked to come to an understanding with her. She
was not a child, surely she did not hold those words
spoken by him, that ring put on her finger, as binding
them together?</p>

<p class="indent">He was thinking over this, scheming how he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
meet her, when one of his men came to him and
said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur Jean, have you seen your father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When? Just now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the man, &quot;recently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Antoine, not for several hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor has anyone else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not seen my father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Monsieur Jean, we have been looking for
him in every direction, and cannot find him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is in the castle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Monsieur Jean, there he is not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is in the field.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Monsieur Jean, he is nowhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is not possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is nowhere that we can find, and no one has
seen him leave&mdash;no one knows whether he has been
carried off again, and if so, how, when, or by whom?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was so&mdash;Ogier del&#39; Peyra had vanished, not
leaving a trace behind him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="center">THE CASTELLAN.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Le Gros Guillem</span> was pacing the stone-vaulted
hall of the Castle of Domme. It was a hall that ran the
whole depth of the castle, from one face to the other,
and was lighted solely by large windows to the north,
commanding the valley of the Dordogne. The room
was vaulted, not ribbed; cradled with white stone,
the walls were of stone, and the hall was paved with
stone&mdash;all of one whiteness. No tapestry covered the
naked sides, nor carpets clothed the floors, only some
panelling of oak to man&#39;s height took off some of the
chill of the walls, and straw was littered on the floor.
Of ornament there was none in the hall, unless weapons
and defensive armour might be so regarded.
Even antlers and boars&#39; heads were absent. The occupants
of the castle had other amusements than the
chase.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must have thirty men more,&quot; said the Captain.
&quot;Let Heliot ride into the Bretenoux country; he will
get them there; and let that sulky Amanieu, who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
neither one of us nor against us, go to Gramat, on
the bald and barren Causse, where nothing grows save
lank and hungry men, there is always a supply of
daredevils to be had for the asking. Offer what you
will&mdash;we must make an attempt on Bergerac&mdash;and
have the looting of its fat merchants&#39; houses. We
will make a raid into Sarlat and put the oily canons
into the olive-press. There is plenty to be had for
the taking. I want men. I must have more men. I
dare not leave Domme without a thumb on it to hold
it down; and there is that accursed eye of La Roque
watching unwinkingly. Fine times are coming. I
hear that the English are sending an army under the
great Talbot. Let us do something&mdash;pick over the
vineyard before he comes or the Englishmen will
have the biggest bunches.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">One of the attendants came up to the Captain and
informed him that there was an old man desired to
speak with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does he want? Where does he come from?
I want no old men. The young are those who can
serve me. I have not here an almshouse for bedemen,
but a training school for soldiers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will not say what he wants&mdash;except only that
he comes on matters of extreme importance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Importance! importance!&quot; repeated Le Gros
Guillem irritably. &quot;Importance to him and not to
me. What is he? a farmer? Some of my boys have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
lifted an ox or carried off a daughter. I will not see
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Captain, he comes from La Roque.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I will have nothing to do with him. I
have no dealings with the people of La Roque. Run
your pikes into his calves and make him skip down
the hill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The attendant retired but returned shortly with a
slip of paper, which he put into the Captain&#39;s hand.
Guillem would have thrust it aside. &quot;A scribbling
petitioner&mdash;worst of all! Does he look as if he had
money? Can he be made to pay? If so we will put
him in the mortar and pound him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With careless indifference Guillem opened the
paper and read the lines&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Messire le Gros,&mdash;If you want a lodging in La
Roque now is your opportunity.</p>

<p class="author">From one who has charge of the keys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eh! eh!&quot; exclaimed the Captain, flushing over
his bald head, and his long fingers crushed the paper
in excitement. &quot;What! a chance of that? Show
him in&mdash;and you, guard, stand at a distance at the
door.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In another moment an old man with short-cut
grey hair was introduced. He walked with the aid of
a stick, and kept his eyes on the ground. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
habited in a shabby dark suit, out at elbows, somewhat
clerical in cut, and he was shaved like a priest.
His face was singularly mottled, in places yellow with
sunburn, elsewhere white. He had bushy eyebrows
that contrasted singularly with his close-clipped head
and his smooth jaws.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So!&quot; said Guillem, striding up to him, &quot;you
have the keys&mdash;and who are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Messire Captain, I am your very humble servant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To the point! What are you at La Roque, and
what do you want with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Messire, I am now caretaker of the fortress in
the cliff. I hold the keys and am responsible for its
custody.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what brings you here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Messire, I am willing to let you in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! On what terms?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Messire&mdash;I trust to your generosity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is not a usual mode of doing business.
Why do you come to me? Why betray your trust?
There is a reason&mdash;is it money? I will pay. What
do you demand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ask no money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then in Heaven&#39;s name what do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Revenge!&quot; answered the old man, and bowed
his head lower over his staff.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Revenge! Hah! I can understand that. Revenge
on someone in La Roque?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
&quot;On someone who is not there now, but who will
be there on the night that I admit you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you ask me to revenge your wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will do that for myself, Messire&mdash;only I can do
nothing now. I am prepared to admit you within
the walls of the town. I can do better than that&mdash;I
will give you access to the castle&mdash;the town without
the castle is nothing. The castle in itself is nothing.
But the castle commands the town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hah! let us in, within the walls of La Roque,
and we will soon have the castle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think that, Messire? You are mistaken.
The castle is victualled for three months. There is a
well in it that never runs dry. There is a garrison
under the Sieur François de Bonaldi, brother of the
Bishop. If you took the town with my help, it would
be cracking the nut and not getting the kernel.
From the castle they could rain down rocks on
you, and if you attempted to hold the town they
would dislodge you, though it might ruin the houses.
No&mdash;the town without the castle is an eyeball without
the iris. Take the castle and the town is
yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may be right,&quot; said Le Gros Guillem, after
a pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am positive I am right,&quot; said the old man,
looking up and dropping his eyes again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, then, do you propose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
&quot;On a night&mdash;let us say to-morrow before midnight,
I will admit you and five men&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not more?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Harken, Messire, I have thought the plan out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on!&mdash;I am impatient to hear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is you, Messire le Gros, who have interrupted
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on with your plan! If I do not approve, I
will none of it. I am not going to run into a trap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A trap! Oh, Messire, how can you think of
that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me your plan at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is this, Messire. I will let you in through the
postern gate on the upper&mdash;the Vitrac&mdash;Sarlat Road,
you and five men&mdash;no more. As many as you will
need can be admitted later; they shall remain without
till the castle is in your hands, and then two of your
men who will tarry by the gate will unbar to them and
let them all enter. But consider, Messire, it will not do
to allow access to more than five at the outset&mdash;there
are sentinels on the walls. I have no understanding
with them, and they might see and give the alarm. If
the alarm were given before you had obtained possession
of the castle, then the whole expedition would be
in vain. If you hold the castle you have the heart of
La Roque Gageac in your hands.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you will admit us into the fortress?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will admit you and three men.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
&quot;It is not enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It suffices. There are but six men in the castle&mdash;and
no guard is kept at night, for none is needed, as
you will see when you get there. That on the town
walls suffices; one of these men is in agreement with
me. Him you must pay, but not me. I shall be well
indemnified if I get my revenge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So then&mdash;you will first open the gate to me and
five men. Then, two are to be left in charge of the
gate, I and three others are next to be given admittance
to the castle, where we are to overpower the
garrison. You say there are but six men. That is
very few.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Messire, the Bishop says he can afford no more,
and his brother, the Sieur François, has written to urge
him to supply him with more, but he says that his
treasury is exhausted and his land impoverished, and
that there are no more men to be got. Besides, what
they reckon on is for the whole garrison of the town
to fly to the castle should the walls of the town fall
into the enemy&#39;s power. It has never entered into
their heads that the citadel should be first grasped,
and the citadel commands all&mdash;it commands the town,
it commands the road to Sarlat, it commands the
whole country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the Bishop says there is nothing to be got&mdash;no
money?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So he says; that is the reason he gives. He told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
the Sieur François to do his best with the handful he
has; he was unable to assist further.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We will speedily prove if his words be true. We
shall soon make him beat his head to think that he
was so parsimonious that he had scruples about melting
up his church plate. That only is an exhausted
land which yields naught when it has passed through
my sieve.&quot; Guillem halted in his walk, laid one hand
on the shoulder of the old man, and said, in a tone in
which was some suspicion, &quot;So you will turn traitor,
betray a trust for nothing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon, Messire; I said that I did it to satisfy
my revenge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the Holy Caul of Cahors!&quot;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> laughed Le Gros
Guillem, &quot;revenge is sweet, especially to the old.
When the kisses of women and the clink of spurs
and the fingering of gold no longer charm, revenge is
still palatable. What makes you so lust for vengeance,
old man?&quot;</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<span class="label">[9]</span></a>
<i>La Sainte Coiffe</i>&mdash;a caul in which it was fabled that the
infant Christ was born&mdash;was one of the choice relics preserved
at Cahors. It fell into the hands of the Huguenots at the
memorable capture of Cahors by Henry of Navarre, but was
recovered. It happily disappeared at the Revolution.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Messire! what do the small troubles of a
nobody like me concern you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Guillem let go his hold and recommenced his pacing:
&quot;The Holy Caul to my aid! but I, too, have my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
grievance, and my mouth waters for the same dainty
as does yours. Let me but be established at La Roque,
and they may expect me at Le Peuch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is at Le Peuch, Messire?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Old man, one who has injured my honour; one
to whom I will show no mercy if I but get him in my
grip. From La Roque I can command all the Sarladais,
and I can swoop down at my leisure on Le
Peuch. I shall get gold at Sarlat and blood at Le
Peuch. By Heaven, I do not know which will best
please me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You accept my offer, Messire le Gros?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aye&mdash;to-morrow, at an hour to midnight. Are
you an ecclesiastic?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Messire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have a clerical aspect; but I suppose all who
serve the Bishop assume something of that. Very
well. I shall be there&mdash;I and my men. Will you eat?
Will you drink?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Messire. I have not come from far&mdash;only
across the water. The ferryman put me over.
I made some excuse that I had a married daughter to
visit, and none suspect evil; but I must make speed
and return before mistrust breeds. Mistrust will spoil
all, Messire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well. Go! So we meet to-morrow. If
you fail&mdash;if you prove false, old man&mdash;terrible will be
your lot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
&quot;I shall not fail. Fear not. I shall not eat, I
shall not sleep; I shall count the hours till you come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Le Gros Guillem mused a moment. Then he said:
&quot;What shall be the sign by which you will know we
are there&mdash;at the gate?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will come,&quot; answered the old man, &quot;to the
little postern at the Sarlat gate. It lays on the right&mdash;twenty
strides up the slope; you pass by a vineyard
to it. I will tarry there till I hear you scratch like a
cat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well&mdash;and the word?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The word&mdash;for a merry jest&mdash;as you said it, Le
Peuch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Le Peuch&mdash;so be it,&quot; said the Captain. &quot;Further&mdash;the
main body of men will be posted outside, and
they are not to be admitted till the castle is ours.
How shall I communicate with them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing is easier,&quot; replied the castellan. &quot;When
Messire is above, and has got the men of the garrison
bound, let him ring the alarm-bell. It is in the tower
of the castle gate, and at once your men below will
admit their fellows, and the townsfolk will awake to
discover themselves betrayed, and in the hands of the
illustrious and very generous Captain Guillem.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is good!&quot; said the <i>routier.</i>&quot;You have thought
this plan well out, old man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I have thought it well out. I have been
long about it. I took much consideration before all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
was fitted together. So&mdash;there&mdash;all is agreed. I
wish you well till we meet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The castellan made for the door, but before he
reached it, he rested on his staff, and burst into a
convulsive fit of laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that?&quot; asked the Captain, coming
towards him. &quot;What makes you laugh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excuse me, Messire. I am old, and my nerves
are shaken. I have had much to agitate them&mdash;and
these convulsive fits come on me&mdash;when I think I am
on the eve of a great pleasure&mdash;and it will be a great
pleasure,&quot; he turned and bowed, and made a salutation
with his cap, and with extended hands&mdash;&quot;ah!
Messire a great pleasure, to open the gate, and let you
in!&quot; He bowed profoundly, and went out backwards
laughing and saluting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="center">IN THE HAIL.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Le Gros Guillem</span> was jubilant. He kept his
secret. Not to one of his men&mdash;not even to his lieutenant
did he confide his purpose of surprising the
castle and town of La Roque Gageac, for he well knew
that no secret is safe when once it has slipped over
the lips.</p>

<p class="indent">He was in excellent spirits, in buoyant, boisterous
humour. He laughed and joked with his men, and
Guillem was too grim a man to be often given to
jest. He bade his men look to their arms, and he detailed
those who were to follow him on an expedition.
Whither he was going he did not say&mdash;but with him
that was usual&mdash;he let no breath of rumour escape as
to his destination whenever he made a raid, and on
this account he was almost always successful; he came
down like a bolt out of the sky on some spot, totally
unprepared to resist him, and none could betray his
scheme, and prepare those fallen upon, for none knew
his destination till he started.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
&quot;Heliot!&quot; called Guillem, suddenly arresting himself
as he was drawing a long sword from the scabbard
to examine if it were free of rust. &quot;Did you
observe that old man who was here last evening?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw him come in, Captain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But&mdash;there is something in his face familiar to
me&mdash;I fancy I have seen him before&mdash;and yet&mdash;I am
not sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said that he came from Gageac and had relatives
in this town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That may be it. To be sure&mdash;he told me, a married
daughter&mdash;I have seen him here at some fair,
may be. It will not out of my head, I have seen
him&mdash;and cannot say where. He looks like a broken
priest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As he walked he was bowed, and I could not see
his face, Captain,&quot; answered Heliot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It matters not. Is there any moon to-night,
Heliot?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is a new moon, Captain; you can see her
in the sky, she does not set till early morning, just
before daybreak. But we shall see little of her tonight;
there are thick clouds coming up against the
wind&mdash;piled up as though full of thunder.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So much the better. Heliot, I will tell you now
what is to be done&mdash;we must cross the Dordogne.&quot;
More than that he would not say.</p>

<p class="indent">The city of Sarlat lies at a distance of several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
miles from the river, and is accessible by two valleys,
one of which opens on to the Dordogne under the
rock of Vitrac, a sheer limestone cliff, the top of
which is occupied by a village and castle, the foot
bathed by the river, and the defile up which the road
runs commanded not only by the castle of Vitrac, but
by another, a tower on the further side, and these two
were designed to completely bar the way to the town.
The other way is more tortuous, and was also defended
both by the great castle and rock of Beynac and also
by a low hill in the midst of the open valley that was
likewise fortified. The situation may be best understood
if we imagine a great triangular plateau with
Sarlat at the apex and the Dordogne flowing at the
base; midway on that base stands La Roque.</p>

<p class="indent">With the river thus watched and every road guarded
jealously, it was important for Le Gros Guillem to
cross in the dark, unperceived, lest a warning should
be sent to La Roque, and the garrison be set on the
alert so that the castellan would be unable to fulfil
his engagement.</p>

<p class="indent">As the evening closed in the clouds that had been
noticed by Heliot covered the whole heavens. There
was no wind below; at the same time one must have
been blowing aloft, for the vapours parted and disclosed
the moon and then drifted over its face again,
and through them it peered dimly, like an eye with
cataract over it, or else became totally obscured.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
The men detailed for the expedition were assembled
in the courtyard of the castle. They were not
mounted&mdash;horses were unnecessary and inconvenient.
The tramp might be heard and cause alarm. The
<i>routiers</i> remained in their ranks motionless till the
word was given, and then silently they defiled out of
the castle, through the street of Domme, and the
town portcullis was raised to allow them to pass forth.</p>

<p class="indent">Le Gros Guillem had boats on the river at his
command. And the passage of the Dordogne was
effected in the darkness successfully without attention
being attracted on the opposite bank. The companions
issued from the boats and drew up on the bank
till the Captain gave the command to march, when
they proceeded down the right bank of the river
without speaking and without making any noise.
Owing to the rainfall the way was muddy and the
mud prevented their tramp from being audible.
Shortly before the hour named by the castellan the
entire party was near the Sarlat gate, concealed behind
vineyard walls and bushes.</p>

<p class="indent">The town that was menaced seemed to be buried
in slumber and security. The only light discernible
was the faint glow through the church window of S.
Donat, where the sanctuary lamp burned. There was
not even a light in the castle&mdash;which in the general
darkness was indiscernible&mdash;only the mighty cliff into
which it was built stood high overhead like a gigantic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
wave ready to fall and bury everything beneath it.
The Captain picked out the men he had fixed on to
accompany him and gave his instructions to the
others in a whisper. As soon as the alarm-bell
sounded in the castle they were to draw rapidly to the
gate. Their comrades within would open, &quot;and,&quot;
said Guillem, &quot;the town is yours&mdash;to do as you please
therein.&quot; Then he advanced cautiously with his five
men to the postern at the side and not to the main
gate. This postern was small, it would admit but one
man at a time.</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching it Guillem scratched with the point
of his sword, and the signal was answered at once&mdash;cautiously
the door was unbarred and unlocked and
the castellan appeared in it. The clouds had momentarily
parted and the new moon gleamed forth
and was reflected by the river. Guillem could perceive
that this was the same man who had visited him
at Domme.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The word?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Le Peuch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is well, Le Peuch. How many?&quot; he asked
under his breath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Myself and five,&quot; answered Guillem.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is well&mdash;let two men remain here. The others
follow me.&quot; He led the way up a steep stair of stone
steps, past houses built into the rock, past the little
church, one wall of which was the rock itself, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
roadway lay almost level with the eave. There was a
clock in the tower, it throbbed like the pulse of a living
being&mdash;the pulse of the whole town, but it beat
evenly, as if the town was without fear.</p>

<p class="indent">The road lay beneath some houses; for, in order
to penetrate from one portion of the town to another,
to reach from one ledge of rock with the buildings
occupying it where every foot of ground was precious,
the path was conducted beneath chambers, in which,
overhead, the citizens were peacefully sleeping, unsuspicious
of what was proceeding below.</p>

<p class="indent">In another moment the platform had been reached
below the sheer cliff that rose without so much as a
shelf on which a shrub could root itself, even of a
cranny in which a pink or harebell might cling.</p>

<p class="indent">All was now so dark that Guillem could not see
his guide or his men.</p>

<p class="indent">Not a sound had been heard in the town&mdash;and
here there was nothing audible save a cat that was
mewing. It had been shut out of a house and feared
that a storm was coming on. The time was winter,
the little creature was cold, and it craved for the
warmth and the dryness of the kitchen hearth. The
foolish cat came up to Le Gros Guillem and rubbed
herself against his legs and pleaded for attention. Irritated
at her persistence and cries, the Captain dealt
her a kick which sent her flying and squealing. Then
he regretted that he had done this, lest her shrill cry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
should reach the mistress and induce her to open the
door and show a light.</p>

<p class="indent">But no token followed and showed that the cat
had been heard. Again the creature came near, mewing.
The darkness was so dense that nothing could
be seen, not even the rock in front, only the buildings
round loomed black against the sky that was but a
shade lighter than the rock.</p>

<p class="indent">Then hail rushed down, hissing, leaping, and with
the hail a flash of lightning revealing the blank wall
of rock in front and the floor over which the hailstones
ran and spun.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is the stair?&quot; asked Le Gros Guillem of
the castellan, who kept at his side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stair&mdash;what stair?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The way by which we are to mount into the
castle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old man chuckled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait a while,&quot; said he in a whisper. &quot;When
next the lightning flashes look ahead of you&mdash;a little
to the right, and you will see a cobweb path up the
face of the rock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lead us to the path&mdash;cobweb or not we will
mount it. We are accustomed to that, and this is
tedious&mdash;tarrying here. Curse that cat! Here she is
again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Messire&mdash;you do not comprehend. Have
you never been in La Roque?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
&quot;I? Never! Do you suppose they would suffer
me within the walls?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, Messire, you cannot understand how it is
that of the garrison none are awake, how it comes that
there is no need for watchfulness. Wait a while, the
lightning&mdash;there&mdash;did you see?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old man pointed in the direction of the stair.
The construction of this path of ascent has been already
described. It consisted of a ladder of pegs
driven into the rock, each peg sustained by a wedge
underneath it. Nothing was easier than by a blow to
loosen the wedge and to throw the steps down, and
when down no passage could be effected to or from
the castle along the face of the rock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you observe?&quot; asked the old man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I observed nothing save a stair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look at the base of the stair. Ah! the hail!
how it whitens the ground, how it lights up the landscape.
One can see a little now, and presently, if you
will have patience, Messire, I will explain it all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want no explanation, I want to mount the stair
and enter the castle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot mount the stair. It is not possible.
There&mdash;another flash&mdash;now do you see? All the
lower portion is removed, so that, till put together
again in the morning, no one can ascend. Moreover,
there aloft is a landing place, and between that landing
place and the gate there is a gap&mdash;and over that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
a draw-plank is lowered. Now, at night, all the lowest
rungs of the stair are taken away and above the
plank is lifted. There is no possibility of anyone
mounting by that means.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, in the devil&#39;s name, why have you brought
us here? I tell you, old man, I will drive my poignard
down your throat if you have dared to deceive
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I deceive you! Oh, Messire! There is a second
way of entering the castle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And that is&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again the lightning flickered, and now the clouds
parting allowed the moon to flash over the whitened
earth and show the great wall of chalk rock in front
mounting into the sky and white as the ghostly clouds
touched by moonlight that moved above it. The freebooter
saw something hanging down the face of the
cliff. It was a rope, and at the end was a bar of wood
some two feet long which it held in a horizontal position
by a knot in the middle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My good friend, whom you will have to reward,
is above at the windlass. You can mount, Messire.
I have but to shake the cord and put my fingers into
my mouth and hoot as an owl and he will begin to
wind up. It is by this means that provisions are carried
up, and by this one can go up or down when the
passage of the stair is cut off. Will you please to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
mount first&mdash;or shall I, most honoured Captain?&quot;
The castellan took off his hat and bowed.</p>

<p class="indent">Le Gros Guillem looked up a sheer height of a
hundred feet; in the uncertain light it appeared as
though this cord was let down out of the sky. He
was a man who rarely knew fear&mdash;in the heat of conflict
he never knew it at all. He was dauntless in
every daring feat; but this was a venture sufficient to
make even him hesitate. He knew not who was the
man at the capstan above. He was not sure that the
rope would endure his weight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; said the castellan, &quot;if you are afraid to
trust yourself to this cord, you must e&#39;en return by
the way you came. I thought other of Le Gros Guillem,
of the famous Captain. I did not think he
would quail as a girl from such a trifle as this. I
will ascend first, and then you may pluck up heart to
follow an old man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The castellan went to the rope and shook it twice,
then imitated the scream of an owl, and instantly
planted himself on the pole and held the cord with
both hands. He began at once to ascend.</p>

<p class="indent">The sky cleared of thunder-cloud and the wan
new moon illumined the scene. The rock was white,
and against it mounted a dark figure with a darker
shadow. The windlass moved noiselessly; Le Gros
Guillem and his men below heard no sound. The
dark figure slid up the rock and became smaller, ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
smaller, and then disappeared. In the uncertain
light, at the great elevation they could not see, but
supposed the castellan had passed through a window
into the castle.</p>

<p class="indent">Then rapidly down came rope and pole, and the
latter hung swaying at a couple of feet above the hail-strewn
platform.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the devil&#39;s name, I will try it!&quot; said Guillem,
and committed himself to the bar. He grasped
the rope and hooted. At the same moment the cat
leaped and lighted on his shoulder. He would have
thrust it off, but could not. The rope had tightened,
was straining, and he was carried upwards off
his feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="center">THE FOURTH TIME.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> rock of Gageac somewhat overhung, so that
as Le Gros Guillem ascended he swung clear in
space. Only occasionally was there a projection
against which he could apply his foot, but he avoided
doing this lest he should set the cord in oscillation.</p>

<p class="indent">The rope was so stout and the piece of wood on
which he was seated so strong, that the momentary
qualm that had come over his heart left it, and he
felt naught save impatience to reach the castle and
creep in at the window. Then his comrades would
be drawn up and all four would fall on the sleeping
garrison, kill every man, ring the tocsin, and the
place would be in his possession, the houses given up
to pillage and the inhabitants to outrage and murder.
To win La Roque&mdash;a place that through the Hundred
Years&#39; War had not been taken, that for three centuries
had defied the English&mdash;would indeed be an
achievement, and one for which he could obtain any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
terms he liked to ask from the Earl of Shrewsbury
on his arrival in Guyenne.</p>

<p class="indent">The clouds were dispersing, Guillem looked up,
the floor of Heaven was as it were spilt over with
curds; he looked down, every platform, roof, garden,
was white with hail. On the horizon lightning was
still fluttering. He had heard no thunder when below&mdash;he
heard none now.</p>

<p class="indent">The Dordogne flowed black through a white
world. It did not reflect the sky to one rising so
high in the air above it; it was black as Acheron and
seemed to have lost all flow&mdash;to be stilled in its course.</p>

<p class="indent">The moon was still shining on the wall of rock,
Guillem&#39;s shadow passed with him, as substantial
apparently as himself, undergoing strange, monkey-like
contortions against the rocky inequalities. A
curse on that cat! It was wailing in his ear. He
turned his chin to endeavour to force the brute from
his shoulder. The cat clung with its thorn-like
claws that pierced his jerkin. He disengaged a hand,
and laid hold of the cat, but it bit and tore at his
hand, it drove its claws into his neck, and he could
not shake it off without tearing away ribbons of his
flesh as well.</p>

<p class="indent">His efforts to rid himself of the cat set the cord
spinning, and the stick revolved, with him on it, and
then spun back again; it began to swing, and in
swinging jammed him against the rock.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
He must make up his mind to endure the cat. It
was but for a minute or two longer, and then he
would be free, and would grasp the accursed brute
and fling it down on to the houses beneath. A cat
has nine lives. A cat will always fall on his feet.
This puss must have more than nine lives if it
escaped being dashed to pieces by such a fall.</p>

<p class="indent">All was hushed below.</p>

<p class="indent">Guillem, looking down, could see the black spots
that he knew represented his three men who were to
follow him.</p>

<p class="indent">Something brushed his face&mdash;it was a sprig of
juniper&mdash;he knew it by the scent; and now he saw
that he had reached that point where rock and wall
were blended, the rock running up into ragged points,
the gaps filled in with masonry, and finally courses of
ashlar lying evenly above the rock.</p>

<p class="indent">He was nearing the window. In another minute
he would be inside. He could hear the creak of the
windlass. His progress upwards seemed to him to be
extraordinarily slow. One line of wallstone, then
another, then a third, then a halt.</p>

<p class="indent">He expected to be able to grasp the threshold of
the window and to assist those within in drawing him
through. But the window sill was some feet above
his head; it was beyond his reach.</p>

<p class="indent">Why had those working the capstan ceased to
turn the levers? Were they exhausted? Had they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
galled their hands? Half a dozen turns and he would
be aloft.</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment, one of those inexplicable, unreasonable
sensations that do occasionally seize the
imagination swept over the mind of Guillem. Looking
at the limestone before him, he all at once
thought it resembled the flesh of old Ogier del&#39;
Peyra&#39;s face as he was lowered into the oubliette,
with the light from the dungeon door sitting on it.
There was absolutely no similarity save that the rock
was grey, and that it was illumined by the new moon
with some such a colourless cadaverous light as that
which had lighted the face of the man sentenced to a
living tomb.</p>

<p class="indent">Le Gros Guillem shook his head and closed his
eyes to free himself from the impression.</p>

<p class="indent">Immediately the cat, driving its claws into his
neck under the right ear, sprang on his head, ran up
the rope and leaped in at the window above.</p>

<p class="indent">It was perhaps due to the fact that those working
the capstan were frightened by the apparition of the
beast; but suddenly the rope was run out and Guillem
dropped through space, to be brought up by a jerk as
those above mastered the spokes and arrested the
flight of the rope.</p>

<p class="indent">As the falling man was stopped in his descent, the
strands of the cord were strained and some snapped.
The jerk would have thrown him from his seat had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
he not grappled the rope with desperation. He had
not, however, dropped very far, and now to his great
satisfaction he felt that the men above were again
turning the levers, and that he was again being steadily
hauled upwards. When aloft he would chastise
them sharply for their scare about a cat, risking
thereby his valuable life.</p>

<p class="indent">Again the juniper bush brushed his face, it was as
an elfin hand which was thrust forth out of the rock
to lay hold of him, or at least to warn him against
further progress. Not a plant had been passed springing
out of the sheer cliff. This juniper grew at the
summit of the rock, and at its junction with the masonry
of the castle.</p>

<p class="indent">Much time had elapsed, surely more than an hour,
since he had passed through the postern gate. His
men, concealed in the vineyards, must be impatient
for the signal to enter the town and plunder it.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he heard a harsh, jarring sound like an angry
growl, followed by the strokes of a bell. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;he
reckoned till twelve. It was midnight.</p>

<p class="indent">Again he was ascending past the courses of ashlar,
and again he was brought to a halt at some distance
below the window.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, from above, through the window a face protruded
that looked down on him. The moon was on
the face; it was the colour of the grey rock; it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
blotched like the rock, it was furrowed with age like
the rock. Unlike the rock, two eyes gleamed out of
it, with the moon glinting in them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gros Guillem!&quot; said the man who peered on the
freebooter from above.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Draw me up!&quot; gasped the Captain, &quot;or by&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you threaten&mdash;you&mdash;situated as you are?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I pray you give the windlass another turn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, you pray now, Gros Guillem!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Captain looked above his head at the face that
overhung him. There was in it something that sent
the blood back to his heart. There was in it that
likeness to a someone, uncertain, recalled but unidentified,
that came out now with terrible distinctness,
and insisted on his straining his powers for recognition.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gros Guillem! do you remember me? This is
our final meeting&mdash;the fourth and the last!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At that moment the tocsin pealed forth its summons
from the tower. This tower, planted under a
concave opening in the rock, sent out the ring of the
alarm-bell multiplied thirtyfold below; it flung it
forth in volumes, it sent it up and down the Dordogne
valley&mdash;across it&mdash;over the level land, far,
far away, wave on wave of sound through the still
night.</p>

<p class="indent">At the first note it was as though a magic wand
had touched every house in La Roque. Each window
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
was illumined. Every door was opened, and forth
burst men with torches, all fully armed.</p>

<p class="indent">In a moment the three companions of the Captain
on the platform and the two by the postern were surrounded,
disarmed, bound or cut down. In a moment,
also, from orchards, vineyards, from out of
barns, from behind hedgerows, rose a multitude of
men, peasants, fishermen, soldiers of the Bishop, serving-men,
all with what weapons they could most
readily handle, and closed in on the men of Guillem
who had come forward at the note of the bell with
purpose to enter by the postern. Then ensued on all
sides a wild hubbub of cries, shrieks, shouts of triumph,
curses, prayers for mercy.</p>

<p class="indent">Le Gros Guillem, hanging in mid-air, heard the
uproar, saw the upward glow of light, and knew that
he and his had been drawn into a cleverly contrived
trap, and that he was lost irretrievably. He writhed,
he turned, he looked above&mdash;there he saw but the face
of Ogier remorseless as fate. He looked below&mdash;there
he saw his men, making desperate battle for life, and
falling one by one. He could not distinguish each
individual, but he saw knots of men forming whence
issued cries and the clash of steel, then the knot broke
up and its members dispersed seeking other clusters
which they swelled, and whence issued the same cries
and din of strife.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently a great flare of fire rose from below and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
illumined the whole rock of Gageac. A torch had
been applied to a bonfire of faggots ready stacked on
the platform. By that glare those below saw the suspended
Captain, and uttered a roar of hate and savage
delight. In Guillem&#39;s ears was a singing, and the
growl of voices came in throbs like waves beating on
his brain.</p>

<p class="indent">From those below rose cries of, &quot;Cut the rope!
Cast him down! We will receive him on our pikes.
He shall fall into the fire!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly the cable was let out, and Guillem felt himself
descending. He was glad that it was so. He desired
to be in the midst of men, though these were
his enemies; for he had his sword at his side and he
would die fighting, wounding others, killing those who
sought his life. So to perish were a death befitting a
soldier&mdash;this such a death as he would hail. He put
his hand to his sword and grasped the hilt. His blood
that had curdled in his arteries began to pulsate, the
film that had formed over his eyes was dissipated, and
a flash of eager anticipation came into them.</p>

<p class="indent">But again the rope ceased to be let out. He was
suspended just half-way between the castle and the
platform below, in full view of the townsmen who had
gathered there, standing at a sufficient distance not to
be struck by his falling body; he was in view also of
the little garrison of the castle who had clambered to
the battlements and were looking over at him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
Then he heard a hammering, and saw below men
employed driving the pegs into the sockets in the rock,
and fastening the wedges that held them firm. No
sooner was the full connection made than up the stair
ran men and even women, and boys who had scrambled
out of bed, and these stood in a line against the
rock up the lengthy ladder-stair gazing at the suspended
man. Then also from above the draw-bridge
was lowered, and the men-at-arms who had been in the
castle ran out of the gate and ran down the stair to
have a better sight thence of the swinging, helpless
man than they could from the battlements.</p>

<p class="indent">A terrible spectacle it was that they witnessed&mdash;such
a one as could not be looked on by Christian
people unmoved save in such an evil age as that, when
men were rendered ferocious as wild Indians and callous
to the sufferings of their brethren; a spectacle
such as could not be looked on without pity save in
such a place as that where all had suffered in some
degree from the exactions or the barbarities of this
wretched man. The flames danced and curled as if
they also frolicked at the sight of the agony of the man
who had so often fed them with hard-won harvests of
the peasantry, and the humble goods of the cottager
too worthless to be carried away.</p>

<p class="indent">In the glare of the leaping bonfire Le Gros Guillem
was distinctly visible, looking like a monstrous yellow
spider at the end of his line. He thrust out now one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
long leg, then another, next he extended his lengthy
arms each armed with lean and bony fingers. He
endeavoured to scramble into a standing position upon
his bar, but failed&mdash;one side would descend before the
other, and he nearly fell in attempting this impossible
feat. He gripped the rope with hands and knees and
endeavoured to swarm up it, but the cable was rendered
slippery by its passage over a roller in the window.</p>

<p class="indent">Rage was in his heart, rage at being there a sight
to men, women, and children, without power of
spreading destruction about him before he died.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he swung himself laterally, hoping to be
able to reach a projection of rock whence possibly he
might creep up or down, or even laterally from jutting
point to point, holding by his fingers till he attained
the stair. As he came swinging like a pendulum he
was carried close to the stairway, and those upon it
held their breath and drew back against the rock,
thinking he would make a leap in attempt to light on
the steps. Were he to do this, then to arrest himself
from falling backwards, with his long fingers he would
inevitably clutch at them, and so precipitate them
along with himself below.</p>

<p class="indent">Those persons standing on that portion of the
steps within range sidled upwards or else downwards,
to be out of the risk of such a danger. They could see
in the upward flash of the firelight the sparkle in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
great eyes as he glared at the steps, calculating his
distance, making resolve to leap, and his heart failing
him or his judgment assuring him that to do so were
certainly fatal.</p>

<p class="indent">A tinkle of a little bell. The priest of S. Donat
had hastily donned his surplice, and run and taken
the Holy Sacrament, and was coming&mdash;he alone with
a thought of mercy for the agonised, to obtain for him
release, or to administer consolation in death. Before
him went a boy with a lantern, ringing the bell.</p>

<p class="indent">Then a loud voice from below cried: &quot;Cut the
cable!&quot; And then: &quot;It is I&mdash;Francis Bonaldi&mdash;I, the
governor, say it. Enough! Cut the cable!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A gasp from all that multitude.</p>

<p class="indent">The cord had been chopped through before the
priest arrived.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="center">A HELEBORE WREATH.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> destruction of Le Gros Guillem&#39;s body of
men at La Roque Gageac was the prelude to the
surrender of the citadel of Domme. The small
garrison left in charge of that stronghold was panic-stricken
when it heard the tidings from La Roque.
The whole country was in arms. The citizens had
marshalled in the square, and the soldiers, deserting
the town, had taken refuge in the castle. Without
head, without prospect of relief, hemmed in by the
Bishop&#39;s troops that arrived from Sarlat and La
Roque on one side, menaced from Beynac, where
was a royal garrison, on another, and from Fénelon
on a third, where the baron was loyal to the French
crown as well as a personal enemy of Guillem, the
remnant of the Company that had acknowledged
Guillem as Captain was fain to capitulate; and the
confederate troops under the governor of La Roque
were content to accord terms, knowing the danger of
driving these freebooters to desperation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
They were suffered to march forth with their
arms. They retreated up the Dordogne to Autoire,
an impregnable stronghold, at that time in the power
of a Chief of Companies, who they knew would welcome
them, and afford them fresh opportunities of
ravage and of gaining spoil.</p>

<p class="indent">The history of France presents but one period of
greater horror than that of the Free Companies&mdash;namely,
the epoch of the wars of religion. But practically
these latter wars were the outcome of the former.
For three hundred years the barons and the great
seigneurs of Aquitaine had been free to act in accordance
with their passions, uncontrolled by any
hand. They had made war against each other on no
provocation; they had made the cities and commercial
towns their common prey. The only possible way in
which a community of peaceful citizens or of villagers
could struggle on was by contracting patis or compacts
with the barons, whereby they undertook to pay
them an annual sum, and on this agreement were
freed from vexation by his armed men. The younger
sons of the barons, and bastards, collected about them
the scum of society, runaway serfs, escaped felons,
adventurers from Spain, from Brabant, from Italy,
but chiefly Gascons, drilled them, armed them, maintained
them in strict discipline, captured such castles
as seemed to them most advisable centres as dominating
fertile districts, or else constructed others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
wherever was a rock that lent itself to defence; and
thence they carried their arms in all directions. They
came in torrents down from the Causses and the
Cevennes upon Languedoc. They ravaged Auvergne,
they carried their incursions into Berry and the Limousin.
The king of France, the estates of the
several provinces, were powerless to rid the country of
them. Again and again vast sums of money were
collected and poured into their bottomless purses, and
the Companions promised on receipt of these sums to
surrender their castles and quit the country. But
very generally they only half-fulfilled their undertaking.
They yielded up a fortress or two; they
drifted off over the Pyrenees into Spain, or over the
Alps into Italy, and not finding there the spoil they
wanted, or meeting there with reverses, they turned
their faces again toward France and reoccupied their
old nests or constructed fresh ones, and all the old
evils returned in aggravated form.</p>

<p class="indent">The mediæval historian Villani, who died in 1363,
gives an account of the formation of one of these
terrible bands, which may serve as an example of the
constitution of all. He says that in 1353 a knight
of St. John of Jerusalem, wearied of his order and its
discipline, renounced his vows and formed a Company
of Free Companions in the marches of Ancona.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brother Moriale called together by letter and
message a great number of soldiers out of employ.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
He bade them come to him, and promised to defray
their expenses and to pay them for their services.
This succeeded admirably; he gathered about him
fifteen hundred bassinets and more than two thousand
comrades, all men greedy to live at the cost of others.&quot;
Very speedily this Company began its ravages. &quot;They
rode about the country and pillaged on all sides.
They attacked Feltramo, took it by storm and killed
five hundred men. As the country round was rich
they remained in Feltramo a month, ravaging it.
During the period of these incursions the terror
inspired by the Company made every castle in the
neighbourhood surrender. Crowds of mercenaries
who had finished their term of service flocked to
Moriale, hearing exaggerated rumours of the great spoil
gained by the Company, and many soldiers refused all
engagements, saying that they would serve under this
freebooter only.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Moriale observed the greatest exactitude in the
distribution of the booty. Objects that had been
stolen were sold by his orders, and he gave free passes
to purchasers, so that by this means men who had
been plundered might come to the fair he held
and recover by payment the goods of which they
had been despoiled. He instituted a treasurer, and
had regular accounts kept of what was taken, and
what prices were paid for things sold. He exacted
as strict obedience as any feudal lord. He administered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
justice, and his judgments were invariably
executed.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not till long after the English domination
had ceased, and which had furnished these ruffians
with an excuse for their violence, that the plague of
the Free Companies was put down. One of the very
worst of all was that of the &quot;Ecorcheurs,&quot; or Flayers,
and had nothing whatever to do with the English.
It was headed by Alexander de Bourbon, a mere boy,
who had been given minor orders to enable him to
hold a fat canonry. The Flayers professed &quot;that all
the horrors hitherto committed from the beginning
of the war would be but as child&#39;s play compared to
their exploits.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A great Council of Captains of Companies was held
at Monde, in the Gevaudan, in 1435, when the soil of
France, of Aquitaine, of Languedoc, of Provence was
parcelled up among them, each having his region
allotted him in which to plunder and work havoc.</p>

<p class="indent">So long as the English held Aquitaine it was impossible
for the crown of France to control this terrible
plague. Every baron, every little noble, as well
as every great prince who found his liberty in the
least touched, his misdeeds reproved, at once transferred
his allegiance to the English crown, and the
English king was too far off, and too greatly in need
of assistance, to be nice in choosing his partisans, and
not to wink at their misdoings.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
The money that had been taken from Levi was
restored by Jean del&#39; Peyra, but not without murmurs
from those who had assisted in the capture of l&#39;Eglise
Guillem. The peasants could see the justice in surrendering
every article recovered to the claimants who
could establish their rights and show that they had
been plundered of these objects. Even the book of
the Chanson de Geste of Guerin de Montglane had
found an owner. Most of the ecclesiastical goods had
been restored to churches. Articles of clothing had
been divided among those who had helped to take
and destroy the vulture&#39;s nest. This all seemed to
them reasonable enough, but that so large a sum as a
hundred livres should be surrendered to a dog of a
Jew, solely because he had been despoiled of it&mdash;that
was what they could not understand. If he had been
robbed of the money it was well&mdash;Jews were made to
be plundered. Equal justice was not due to those
who had crucified the Christ. Jean, had however,
been firm, and had held to his intention. Rather than
irritate the peasants to rebellion against his decision,
he surrendered to them his entire share in the spoil
of the robber&#39;s stronghold.</p>

<p class="indent">The gratitude of the Jew at the unexpected recovery
of his money was profuse. Jean paid little regard
to his demonstration. A year later and he had
reason to congratulate himself on having done an act
of justice, for Levi assisted him in the purchase of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
the Seigneurie of Les Eyzies with it feudal stronghold
and the flourishing village at its feet. But this
is an event of the future. We are concerned now
only with what took place in the memorable winter
that saw the destruction of the band of Le Gros Guillem,
and that preceded the great battle of Castillon
and the ruin of the English cause in Guyenne.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean had become exceedingly anxious to obtain
tidings of Noémi. After the terrible death of her
father, the butchering of his followers, the surrender
of Domme, and the dispersion of the remainder of
his band, he knew not what had become of her.
She had relatives at La Roque&mdash;the Tardes&mdash;that he
knew, and he was therefore satisfied that she was not
homeless and destitute. But that anything out of
the wreck of Le Gros Guillem&#39;s accumulations had
been preserved for her, he was doubtful. Who Guillem
was, whence sprung, of what parents, no one
knew. Whether he had any surname no one could
say. Like many another Captain of the period he
had escaped from the common mass of adventurers
by the force of his abilities, by his superior power, by
his daring courage. It had been so with that redoubted
soldier of fortune, &quot;Le petit Meschin,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> who
from a scullion had risen to be the scourge of whole
provinces, and to defeat and well-nigh exterminate a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
royal army under a prince of the blood. Even renegade
priests had headed bands of brigands and distinguished
themselves by their outrages of all laws
human and divine.</p>

&quot;Picciolo servo fuggito, di oscura lugo nato.&quot;&mdash;Villani.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The &quot;Eglise Guillem&quot; in the rocks of the left
bank of the Vézère was no inheritance of the robber
chief, but had been taken by him and occupied as a
stronghold of his own, and none had dared to reclaim
it and attempt to dislodge him, till the attack by the
peasants that has been recorded.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean felt that a painful obligation lay on him to
see Noémi. Her father had met with a terrible death
at the hands of his father, who had played with the
wretched man as a cat with a mouse before he had
cut the cord and precipitated him to his death. Le
Gros Guillem had forfeited every right to command
sympathy by his treatment of Ogier&mdash;in casting him
down the <i>oubliette</i> and then by his treacherous attempt
to have him murdered by his two men-at-arms.
Nevertheless, he was Noémi&#39;s father, and his mangled
corpse lay between Jean and her, and across that and
the terrible wrongs committed by the dead man
and the revengeful execution the hands of Jean and
Noémi could never meet.</p>

<p class="indent">But the word of affiance had been spoken, and
spoken solemnly, before many witnesses, and it had
been sealed with the giving of a ring. Such a word
could not be broken. In popular superstition it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
bound even beyond the grave. Release could be had
only by mutual consent and the restoration of the
pledge. Jean rode to La Roque, full of trouble at
heart. He loved Noémi, he greatly esteemed her.
He saw in her a noble soul struggling to its birth with
aspirations after something better than what she had
known&mdash;gladly would he have taken her to be his,
and helped this uncertain, restless, eager spirit to unfold
its wings, to break out of its shell, to look up and
to soar into a pure atmosphere&mdash;but it might not be.
The terrible shadow of Le Gros Guillem, the awful
story of the past made this impossible.</p>

<p class="indent">As he was nearing La Roque, he suddenly drew
rein&mdash;he saw Noémi. She was seated on a mass of
brown fallen leaves, and was plucking helebore
flowers. Even that act struck Jean to the heart.
&quot;She plays with poison&mdash;seeks out the noxious, the
deadly,&quot; he said. He leaped to the ground, and holding
the rein of his horse came to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi, what are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am making a chaplet for the grave of my
father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of helebore?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What else suits? Would you have it of the innocent
flower of the field? On such he trampled.
They call this the wolf&#39;s flower&mdash;enfin! It is a
flower!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi, do you know why I have come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
She stood up, holding the half-finished wreath in
her hands and looking down. She did not answer,
tears filled her eyes and trickled over her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi,&quot; said he gravely, &quot;you recall that incident
by the charcoal-burner&#39;s lodge, that moment
of terrible danger when the peasants, mad with revenge
and success and the blood of the wolves they
had killed, would have torn you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not answer. As she raised her hand with
the helebore wreath, he saw that the ring was on her
finger where he had placed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I said what I did then, and I placed on your
finger that ring, which is indeed your own&mdash;as you
had entrusted it to me to show to your father&mdash;and I
declared before all present that you were affianced to
me. It was so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She bowed her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Noémi, you know that this can never,
never be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up quickly, sadly at him. Her eyes
were full of tears.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean was deeply agitated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must return me the ring&mdash;if only for the
form&#39;s sake, so as to undo the pledge and dissolve the
engagement&mdash;I will give it back to you as a surrender
of a loan&mdash;as nothing else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She put her fingers to the ring and drew it off, and
without a word offered it to him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
He took the ring and looked at it, doubtful what
more to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi,&quot; he asked, &quot;whose arms are these
engraved on it? They seem to me to belong to the
Fénelon family.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;they are the Fénelon arms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was the ring&mdash;&mdash;&quot; He was about to ask if it
had been stolen, but checked himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was my father&#39;s ring,&quot; she said in a low tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father&#39;s! Was Le Gros Guillem a Fénelon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Le Gros Guillem! Oh, no! Do you not know
and understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Know, understand what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Le Gros Guillem was not really my father; he
carried off my mother from Fénelon, along with me
when I was an infant in arms. Le Gros Guillem
killed my father, who was the Baron de Fénelon.
But I was a child and I was brought up at Domme.
I knew nothing of that. Le Gros Guillem always
treated me as his child and loved me as such, and I&mdash;I
always called him and looked up to him as father.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi&mdash;is this true?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She gazed at him full in the face. &quot;I am no liar,
Jean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Noémi, throw aside that helebore, open your
arms. To my heart! to my heart! Take back the
ring, all is well, is well. Mine for ever!&quot;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="center">THE ELEVENTH CROSS.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Ogier del&#39; Peyra</span> had returned to Le Peuch
Ste. Soure. His appearance greatly astonished the
people, as his beard and moustachio had been shaved,
and his hair, usually worn very thick and long, had
been clipped close. So transformed was he in appearance
that they could hardly recognise him. It was
not till the story of the exploit of La Roque had
reached them in its entirety that this transformation
was understood.</p>

<p class="indent">Ogier would say nothing about what he had done.
He relapsed into indifference and silence, and appeared
morose and inaccessible. He took no interest
in anything connected with his lands, none whatever
in the great political events that ensued.</p>

<p class="indent">On September 20th, 1452, John Talbot, Earl of
Shrewsbury, disembarked on the coast of Medoc and
entered Bordeaux on the 22d. Several small towns
and fortresses surrendered. Then a large French
army descended into Guyenne. On July 14th, 1453,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
the main body, under the command of the Count
of Penthièvre and the Admiral Jean de Bueil, encamped
at La Mothe-Montravel, and prepared to
lay siege to Castillon that was held by the English.
Talbot at once quitted Bordeaux, accompanied by between
eight hundred and a thousand horsemen, and
followed by from four to five thousand foot soldiers.
He arrived before Castillon on the 17th of July.</p>

<p class="indent">At the approach of the English the French withdrew
to their camp, and were followed by Talbot, who
arrived breathless, his troops exhausted with a long
march. Misinformed as to their numbers, believing
that the French were retreating in alarm, without
waiting to recruit his troops, the Earl of Shrewsbury
resolved on storming the French camp.</p>

<p class="indent">The mistake was fatal. Not only did the French
army vastly outnumber his own, not only was it fresh,
whilst his troops were fagged, but their camp was well
chosen and well defended with artillery that played
upon the English from every side with disastrous
effect. The defeat was complete. Talbot and his
gallant son fell, and their death has been immortalised
by Shakespeare. Nor has the great dramatist
failed to point out the cause of the failure&mdash;the disunion
among the English leaders.</p>

<p class="indent">This memorable battle prepared the way for the
final deliverance of Guyenne and of France, not from
English arms only, but from the plague of the Free
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
Companies, which had grown and spread under the
shadow of the English domination. At length the
south&mdash;which as yet had not been in name even
French&mdash;was absorbed into the kingdom, and partook
of the benefits of union, and began to tingle with the
lifeblood of the nation.</p>

<p class="indent">Ogier del&#39; Peyra resigned all concern relative to
his estates into the hands of his son, or rather the
management was taken from him by Jean, because
the old man could or would attend to nothing himself.
Whether his mind had been affected by his imprisonment
in the <i>oubliette</i>, or whether the inactivity
was constitutional, and when the necessity for exertion
and the motive for revenge were passed he could
no longer rouse himself to action, remained uncertain.
He had expressed no surprise when Jean brought
Noémi to Le Peuch as its mistress. He accepted
whatever happened as a matter of course.</p>

<p class="indent">For long he did absolutely nothing but sit in the
sun and bite pieces of twig and straw. If addressed,
he replied only with a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No,&quot; and gave
tokens of annoyance if anyone was persistent in forcing
a conversation. Whether he was thinking of the
past, or thinking of nothing at all, none could say.
Most certainly he gave no thought to the future, for
he made no provision for the morrow and left everything
to Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">At last he became feeble, and when feeble suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
took it into his head to absent himself for a good part
of the day.</p>

<p class="indent">On inquiry, Jean learned that he crossed the river
taking with him a hammer and chisel; and he was
informed that the old man had been seen scrambling
up the slope to the ruins of l&#39;Eglise Guillem. One
day, accordingly, Jean went after him, and on reaching
the cave-habitation found his father seated on the
floor engaged in chipping with his tools.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you doing, father?&quot; asked Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">The old man did not answer with words, but
pointed to the floor. He had been trimming into
shapeliness the crosses that marked the lives taken at
the storming of l&#39;Eglise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there are eleven, father,&quot; said Jean, pointing
to one larger than the rest, fresh cut.</p>

<p class="indent">The old man nodded. &quot;For Le Gros Guillem,&quot;
he said. &quot;I killed him.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">NOVELS BY HALL CAINE.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>THE MANXMAN.</i> By <span class="smcap">Hall Caine</span>. 12mo.
Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;A story of marvelous dramatic intensity, and in its ethical meaning has a force
comparable only to Hawthorne&#39;s &#39;Scarlet Letter.&#39;&quot;&mdash;<i>Boston Beacon.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A work of power which is another stone added to the foundation of enduring fame
to which Mr. Caine is yearly adding.&quot;&mdash;<i>Public Opinion.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A wonderfully strong study of character; a powerful analysis of those elements
which go to make up the strength and weakness of a man, which are at fierce warfare
within the same breast: contending against each other, as it were, the one to raise him
to fame and power, the other to drag him down to degradation and shame. Never in
the whole range of literature have we seen the struggle between these forces for
supremacy over the man more powerfully, more realistically delineated, than Mr. Caine
pictures it.&quot;&mdash;<i>Boston Home Journal.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The Manxman&#39; is one of the most notable novels of the year, and is unquestionably
destined to perpetuate the fame of Hall Caine for many a year to come.&quot;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Telegraph.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The author exhibits a mastery of the elemental passions of life that places him
high among the foremost of present writers of fiction.&quot;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Inquirer.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>THE DEEMSTER. A Romance of the Isle of
Man.</i> By <span class="smcap">Hall Caine</span>. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;Hall Caine has already given us some very strong and fine work, and &#39;The
Deemster&#39; is a story of unusual power.... Certain passages and chapters have an
intensely dramatic grasp, and hold the fascinated reader with a force rarely excited
nowadays in literature.&quot;&mdash;<i>The Critic.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One of the strongest novels which has appeared for many a day.&quot;&mdash;<i>San Francisco
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fascinates the mind like the gathering and bursting of a storm.&quot;&mdash;<i>Illustrated
London News.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Deserves to be ranked among the remarkable novels of the day.&quot;&mdash;<i>Chicago
Times.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Remarkably powerful, and is undoubtedly one of the strongest works of fiction of
our time. Its conception and execution are both very fine.&quot;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Inquirer.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><i>CAPT&#39;N DAVY&#39;S HONEYMOON. A Manx
Yarn.</i> By <span class="smcap">Hall Caine</span>. 12mo. Paper, 50 cts.; cloth, $1.00.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;A new departure by this author. Unlike his previous works, this little tale is
almost wholly humorous, with, however, a current of pathos underneath. It is not
always that an author can succeed equally well in tragedy and in comedy, but it looks
as though Mr. Hall Caine would be one of the exceptions.&quot;&mdash;<i>London Literary
World.</i></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is pleasant to meet the author of &#39;The Deemster&#39; in a brightly humorous little
story like this.... It shows the same observation of Manx character, and much of
the same artistic skill.&quot;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Times.</i></p>
